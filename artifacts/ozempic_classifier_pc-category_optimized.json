        "complaint": "I use a mail order pharmacy for my Ozempic because it's cheaper than going to the local pharmacy, but this delivery was a disaster. The package was delivered yesterday afternoon while I was at work - it was left on my front porch at around one PM according to the delivery timestamp. I didn't get home until almost seven PM, so it had been sitting out there for about six hours. And yesterday was brutal - we had a heat advisory with temperatures over 95 degrees, and my porch gets direct sun all afternoon. When I picked up the package it felt warm, definitely not cool like refrigerated medication should be. Inside, the gel ice pack that's supposed to keep it cold was completely melted, just warm liquid at that point. And there was one of those temperature indicator strips on the inner packaging, and it clearly showed that the product had been exposed to high temperatures for an extended period. The indicator was red or orange, I forget exactly which, but either way it means the temperature got too high. According to the information sheet, this medication is supposed to stay refrigerated and prolonged heat exposure can make it ineffective or degraded. I called the mail order pharmacy customer service and after being on hold forever, they agreed to send a replacement overnight, but this is a waste of medication and it's concerning that their shipping methods allow this to happen. They need better insulated packaging or refrigerated shipping options, especially for summer deliveries.",
        "reasoning": "The complaint describes that the Ozempic pen was left outside in high ambient temperatures for several hours during delivery, resulting in a melted ice pack and a temperature indicator showing that the product exceeded its recommended storage conditions. This indicates that the medication experienced a temperature excursion during shipping, which can affect its stability and efficacy. The issue is related to improper storage/temperature control rather than a defect in the device, labeling, potency, or packaging integrity itself.",
        "classification": "Storage/Temperature excursion",
        "justification": "The problem stems from the product being exposed to temperatures above the recommended refrigerated range during transport, as evidenced by the melted ice pack and temperature indicator. This constitutes a storage/temperature excursion issue."

        "complaint": "This is really concerning and I haven't even used this pen yet. I opened up the box to inspect the pen before my first dose like the nurse taught me to do, and when I held it up to check that the solution was clear, I saw something floating inside. At first I thought maybe it was just a bubble, but when I tilted the pen back and forth, I could see it's actually like a hair or fiber of some kind. It's thin and looks either white or maybe translucent, kind of moves around in the liquid when I tilt the pen. This is an injectable medication that's supposed to be sterile, so having any kind of fiber or foreign material in there is just not okay. The pen itself was still sealed in its packaging, and the pharmacy seal on the outside was intact, so this isn't something that got in there after it left the manufacturer. I took pictures of it and brought it back to the pharmacy. The pharmacist agreed it shouldn't be there and filed a report with the manufacturer. She gave me a replacement from a different lot and told me to inspect it carefully too. I'm just worried about quality control if stuff like this is getting through their manufacturing process.",
        "reasoning": "The complaint describes a visible foreign fiber/hair inside the sealed medication cartridge, which is a contamination issue. The presence of any particulate matter in a sterile injectable product indicates a breach of manufacturing sterility and quality control, fitting the definition of a contamination/foreign matter defect.",
        "classification": "Contamination/Foreign matter",

        "complaint": "I bought a package that comes with three pens in it because it's supposed to be more economical that way. Started using the first pen and it seemed fine, worked normally through all the doses. Opened the second pen when it was time and something looked weird right away - there's this big air gap at the top of the cartridge, like it's not filled up as much as it should be. The liquid level is noticeably lower than it was in the first pen. Used it for two doses but the air gap looks even bigger now, bigger than it should be for only two doses used. Opened the third pen to compare and that one looks normal, filled to the proper level like the first one was. So two out of three pens from the same package are completely different - one filled properly, two underfilled with excessive headspace. Either they didn't put enough medication in those two pens, or there's a leak somewhere, or the fill volume was wrong during manufacturing. Either way, I'm probably not getting the right amount of medication from those underfilled pens. Contacted the pharmacy and they're replacing the entire 3-pack. They said this is definitely a manufacturing fill or packaging defect and they're reporting it to track if other pens from that lot have the same issue.",

When I look at the little window that's supposed to show you what dose you've dialed and how many doses remain, it's completely blank. Just empty, white or gray space - no numbers visible at all. I've tried looking at it in bright light, in sunlight, with my reading glasses, and there are just no numbers showing. The pen otherwise seems to function - the dial turns and clicks like it should, the solution looks clear and normal - but I have absolutely no way to verify what dose I'm setting or confirm how many doses are left in the pen. The dose counter is a critical safety feature because you need to know you're getting the right amount of medication and track when the pen will be empty. Without being able to see the numbers, I can't safely use this pen. I don't know if the printing somehow got missed during manufacturing, or if there's an internal mechanism that's supposed to display the numbers that's broken. Either way, it's a device malfunction that makes the pen unusable. Pharmacy replaced it and documented the issue. The one they gave me as a replacement has a perfectly clear, readable dose counter like it's supposed to.",

        "complaint": "This is really disturbing. I was inspecting a new pen before first use like I always do, holding it up to the light to check that the solution is clear, and I saw what looks like a black speck or particle floating in the cartridge. It's small, maybe about a millimeter in size, but definitely visible and very dark, almost black, against the clear solution. It's floating freely in the liquid and moves around when I tilt the pen. This pen has never been opened or used - it's brand new, still sealed in the original packaging. The presence of any kind of particulate matter in a sterile injectable medication is totally unacceptable. This is supposed to be a sterile product and there should be nothing floating in it. I took the pen directly to the pharmacy to show them. The pharmacist looked at it under their magnifying light and agreed it's definitely a foreign particle of some kind. She immediately documented everything, took pictures, recorded the lot number, and replaced the pen with one from a different batch. She said they'll be sending this one back to the manufacturer and filing a contamination report. This is a serious quality control issue because that particle could have been injected into someone if they didn't inspect the pen carefully first. Makes me wonder about the sterility and manufacturing conditions if stuff like this is getting through.",

This is now the second time in recent months that they've dispensed Ozempic pens to me that are practically expired. Today I picked up my refill prescription, got home, and checked the expiration dates on the pens like I always do. All of them expire in just nine days. Nine days! I take one dose per week, so with a nine-day window I can maybe use one dose before these pens expire. That's it. The rest will be wasted. This is expensive medication and my insurance doesn't cover wastage like this. When I called the pharmacy to complain, they said this is all they have in stock and can't get better-dated product right now. But here's the thing - this is the second time this has happened with this same pharmacy in the past few months. The last time they gave me pens with only two weeks until expiry, and I told them then that this was a problem. Clearly they're not managing their inventory properly, probably ordering more than they can dispense and then pushing the old stock out to patients before it expires. Or their wholesaler is sending them short-dated product. Either way, it's unacceptable that patients are repeatedly getting medication they can't fully use before expiration. I'm switching to a different pharmacy that hopefully has better inventory turnover and quality control.",

        "complaint": "This is really disturbing and makes me question the sterility of the manufacturing process. I have a brand new, unopened Ozempic pen that was sealed in its packaging when I got it from the pharmacy. Been stored in my fridge properly. Was inspecting it before first use and when I held it up to the light, I could see this tiny thread-like material floating around freely in the solution. It's white or maybe translucent, very thin, moves around when I tilt the pen. At first I thought maybe it was just a weird bubble or optical illusion, but I looked at it with a magnifying glass and it's definitely a fiber of some kind. Looks like a piece of thread or textile fiber under magnification. How does a textile fiber get inside a sealed, sterile pharmaceutical cartridge? The only way that makes sense is if it contaminated the solution during the manufacturing or filling process - like maybe it came off someone's clothing or from the manufacturing environment. This represents a complete sterility breach. This solution is supposed to be sterile for injection and there's a textile fiber floating in it. That's unacceptable. Who knows what bacteria or other contaminants came along with that fiber? The pen was properly sealed and stored, so this isn't user error. This is clearly a manufacturing quality control failure. Brought it immediately to the pharmacy and they were concerned too. Documented everything, they're filing an urgent contamination report with the manufacturer, and obviously replacing the pen.",

        "complaint": "I'm having a mechanical problem with my pen that's preventing me from taking my doses properly. The injection button on the pen is working when I press it - it depresses normally and I can feel and hear the click that indicates the dose is being delivered. That part seems fine. But after I release pressure on the button, it doesn't spring back up to its original position like it's supposed to. Instead, it stays stuck down in the depressed position. Now I can't dial up my next dose because the button needs to be in the up position before the dose selector will turn, and it's stuck down. This happened after only my second dose from a brand new pen, which means there should be four more doses remaining that I now can't access. I've tried gently pulling on the button to see if it would pop back up, but it won't budge. There's clearly something wrong with the spring mechanism or whatever internal component is supposed to make the button reset after each injection. The pen is basically useless now after only two uses. Brought it to the pharmacy and they confirmed it's a device malfunction with the button reset mechanism. They replaced it and are sending the defective one back to the manufacturer. Seems like a pretty serious design or manufacturing defect if the button mechanism fails after just two doses.",

        "complaint": "I had a really weird and concerning experience with my injection yesterday. I very carefully set the dose to exactly 0.5 mg on the dial like I always do - I'm meticulous about this because I know dosing accuracy is important. Attached the needle, did the injection into my abdomen like normal, pressed the button all the way down and held it for the count. But while I was doing it, something felt off. The plunger barely seemed to move, like the injection was over really quick. When I looked at the dose counter after removing the needle, it had only decreased by maybe 0.1 mg worth, definitely not the full 0.5 mg I had dialed. So either the medication didn't come out, or there's something wrong with the mechanism. I ended up having to dial another 0.4 mg or so and inject again, then check, and had to do this like three or four times total before it finally seemed like I'd gotten the full dose. This is very concerning because I have no idea if I'm actually getting accurate dosing from this pen. Is it under-delivering each time? Is the plunger movement indicator broken but the dose is actually correct? I can't tell, and that's a safety issue. The pharmacy had me bring in the pen and they're sending it to the manufacturer for testing because if the dose delivery mechanism isn't working correctly, that's a serious defect. I'm worried about whether I've been getting my full prescribed doses from this pen.",

I'm on the starting dose of 0.25 mg, so I carefully dialed it to exactly that marking like I always do. But when I did the injection, something felt different. The plunger movement seemed to go on longer than usual, and there was this unusual resistance that I hadn't felt before. The whole injection took maybe twice as long as it normally does. I thought maybe I was just imagining things, but over the next few hours I started feeling really off - more nauseous than I've ever been on this medication, kind of shaky, just not right at all. Called my doctor's office and the nurse had me come in. My blood sugar was lower than expected and she was concerned that maybe I got more than the 0.25 mg dose I dialed. Like maybe the pen delivered more medication than what was showing on the dose selector. I had to monitor my blood sugar closely for the next day or so. I still have the pen and I'm afraid to use it again. The pharmacy is having me return it to send to the manufacturer for testing because if the dosing mechanism is off, that's a serious safety issue.

The tracking said delivery would be between 10 AM and 2 PM, but the driver didn't actually show up until almost 6 PM, and when I opened the door to get the package, the driver was just leaving it on the ground and walking away. No temperature controlled vehicle or anything - the package had clearly been sitting in his regular delivery van all day. And this is late June, we've had record high temperatures this week, probably hitting close to 100 degrees today. The package was warm to the touch when I picked it up, and when I opened it, the gel ice packs that were supposed to keep it cool were completely melted and actually warm. The temperature monitoring sticker inside showed clear evidence of prolonged heat exposure - showed temperatures had exceeded safe limits. There's absolutely no way this medication maintained proper refrigeration during delivery. Between sitting in a hot delivery van all day and then being exposed to the heat during delayed delivery, these pens have been subjected to hours of high temperature exposure that definitely exceeds storage specifications. I refused to accept the delivery and made the driver take it back, then called the mail order pharmacy to file a complaint about their delivery service. They need to use refrigerated vehicles or at minimum ensure deliveries happen within reasonable timeframes, especially during hot weather.",

I'm turning the dose selector dial and it's clicking normally, getting up to 1.0, and then suddenly I hear this loud snap sound from inside the pen. Like something broke inside. Immediately after that, the dose selector knob started spinning freely, just rotating without any resistance at all. No more clicking, no stopping at the dose markings, it just spins and spins continuously like the internal mechanism that controls it has completely disconnected or broken. Now I can't set any dose because the selector isn't engaging with anything. I can spin it all day and nothing happens, it doesn't lock into any position. Clearly something snapped or broke inside that's critical to the dose selection mechanism. The pen is basically completely unusable now. I'd only had this pen for a week and was on my second dose from it when this happened. Brought it to the pharmacy and they agreed it's an internal mechanical failure. They documented the lot number and are sending the pen back to the manufacturer to investigate what failed inside.

I picked up my Ozempic prescription and when I got home and opened the carton to read the instructions, I realized all the labeling is in Spanish. Everything - the carton label, the patient information leaflet, all of it. I'm in the United States and my understanding is that pharmaceutical products sold here are required to have English labeling for safety and regulatory reasons. There's no English anywhere on this packaging. Called the pharmacy and they were confused too because they're definitely not a pharmacy that operates in a Spanish-speaking market. The pharmacist said this shouldn't have made it into the US distribution channel with Spanish-only labeling. She checked their records and this batch was from a different supplier than they usually use, possibly diverted from the Latin American market or something. Either way, it's a labeling compliance issue because it doesn't meet the requirements for the US market. Can't even read the important safety information or instructions properly. They replaced it with properly labeled English product, but again, makes you wonder how this kind of mix-up happens and what other problems might exist with that batch.",

The prescription label that the pharmacy printed and stuck on the box says 2 mg, but the actual manufacturer's carton inside says 1 mg. The pen itself also shows 1 mg on the device label. So the pharmacy's system thought they were dispensing 2 mg and that's what they labeled it as, but the actual product in the bag is 1 mg. This is a potentially serious medication error - if I hadn't noticed and had taken my prescribed 2 mg dose using the 1 mg pen thinking it was the right strength, I would have been underdosed. That could affect my blood sugar control and the therapeutic effects I'm supposed to be getting. I immediately went back to the pharmacy to correct this error. The pharmacist apologized profusely and said they must have grabbed the wrong product from the shelf when filling my prescription. Their barcode scanning system should have caught the mismatch, but apparently it didn't. They gave me the correct 2 mg pens and are investigating why their verification system failed to catch the wrong strength. This is scary because if their checking systems aren't working properly, how many other patients are getting the wrong medications or wrong strengths?",

Like a lot of people, I've been frustrated with the cost and shortages of Ozempic, and when I saw an ad online for an international pharmacy offering it at like 60% off the normal price, I jumped on it. Ordered three pens, paid through some payment system I wasn't familiar with, and waited. The pens showed up after about three weeks. At first glance the packaging looks pretty genuine - has the Novo Nordisk branding, the blue pens, all of that. But when I started looking more closely, some things didn't add up. I tried scanning the 2D barcode on the box with my phone using the manufacturer's verification app, and it gave me an error message. Wouldn't scan properly or verify. Then I went to the Novo Nordisk website where they have that verification portal where you can enter the lot number, and when I put in the lot number from my pens, the system said it cannot find that lot number in their database. Like it doesn't exist in their records. And when I looked really carefully at the holographic security seal on the carton, it seems slightly misaligned or crooked, not perfectly applied like I'd expect from a professional pharmaceutical manufacturer. I showed all this to my regular pharmacist and she said these are almost certainly counterfeit and I absolutely should not use them.
