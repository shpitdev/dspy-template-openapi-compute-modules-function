        "complaint": "There's something wrong with the dose counter display on my pen. When I look at the little window that's supposed to show you what dose you've dialed and how many doses remain, it's completely blank. Just empty, white or gray space - no numbers visible at all. I've tried looking at it in bright light, in sunlight, with my reading glasses, and there are just no numbers showing. The pen otherwise seems to function - the dial turns and clicks like it should, the solution looks clear and normal - but I have absolutely no way to verify what dose I'm setting or confirm how many doses are left in the pen. The dose counter is a critical safety feature because you need to know you're getting the right amount of medication and track when the pen will be empty. Without being able to see the numbers, I can't safely use this pen. I don't know if the printing somehow got missed during manufacturing, or if there's an internal mechanism that's supposed to display the numbers that's broken. Either way, it's a device issue that makes the pen unusable. Pharmacy replaced it and documented the issue. The one they gave me as a replacement has a perfectly clear, readable dose counter like it's supposed to.",
        "reasoning": "The dose counter is an integral part of the injection device\u2019s functionality, providing critical information to the user about the selected dose and remaining doses. The complaint describes a blank, unreadable display despite the pen otherwise operating correctly, indicating a failure of the device\u2019s internal display mechanism rather than an issue with storage, packaging, or labeling.",
        "classification": "Device malfunction",
        "justification": "The issue pertains to the malfunction of the dose counter display\u2014a core component of the device\u2019s operation\u2014making it a clear case of a device malfunction rather than a packaging, labeling, or stability problem."

        "complaint": "I opened a new pen yesterday and was doing my routine inspection before the first use, and something about the solution just doesn't look right to me. It appears slightly cloudy, not crystal clear like all my previous pens have been. And there are these tiny bubbles throughout the liquid - really small ones, but definitely there. I let the pen sit upright in the fridge overnight thinking maybe the bubbles would rise to the top and dissipate, you know, like sometimes happens when you first open something. But this morning when I checked it again, the cloudiness is still there and the bubbles haven't gone away at all. All my previous pens from other lots have been perfectly clear and colorless. This one just looks different. The solution might still be okay, but the instructions say it should be clear and the visual appearance is supposed to be checked before each use. Since this one doesn't match what I'm used to seeing and doesn't match the description in the instructions, I don't feel comfortable using it. Contacted the pharmacy and they agreed the appearance sounds abnormal and are replacing it. Better safe than sorry when it comes to injectable medications. They're sending the pen back to the manufacturer to check whether it's a stability issue or contamination or what.",
        "reasoning": "The pen's solution appears cloudy with persistent microbubbles, deviating from the expected clear appearance described in the instructions. This suggests a potential issue with the medication's physical stability or visual characteristics, prompting replacement and manufacturer investigation.",
        "classification": "Stability/Appearance defect",
        "justification": "The complaint focuses on abnormal visual characteristics (cloudiness and bubbles) rather than functional malfunction, pointing to a stability or appearance issue."

        "complaint": "I just opened a brand new Ozempic pen and I'm shocked by what I'm seeing. The solution inside appears milky white instead of clear and colorless like it's supposed to be. It literally looks like diluted milk or a suspension of some kind. This is completely abnormal. I've been using Ozempic for six months now and all my previous pens have had perfectly clear, water-like solution with no color or cloudiness at all. To make sure I wasn't going crazy, I pulled out my almost-empty pen from last week and compared them side by side. The old pen is crystal clear and the new pen is definitely milky white. Both pens have been stored under identical conditions in my refrigerator at the proper temperature, so this isn't a storage issue on my end. A milky appearance in a solution that should be clear indicates either protein aggregation, where the medication molecules are clumping together, or possibly even microbial contamination. Either way, this is a critical quality issue. There's no way I'm injecting this into my body. I wrote down the lot number from the carton before I called the pharmacy. They agreed that milky white appearance is definitely abnormal and potentially dangerous. They're having me return the pen so it can be sent to the manufacturer's quality lab for investigation. They need to figure out what caused this appearance change and whether it's an isolated issue or if other pens from that batch are affected.",
        "reasoning": "The patient reports that a brand\u2011new Ozempic pen contains a milky\u2011white solution rather than the expected clear, colorless appearance. This deviation from the product\u2019s normal visual characteristics points to a problem with the drug product\u2019s appearance and potentially its stability (e.g., protein aggregation). Since the issue pertains to the physical look of the medication rather than a mechanical failure or packaging error, it fits best within the \u201cStability/Appearance defect\u201d category.",
        "classification": "Stability/Appearance defect",
        "justification": "Milky appearance indicates a visual deviation from the expected clear solution, signifying a stability or appearance issue."

        "complaint": "This is pretty concerning. I was setting up for my injection this morning, dialing my dose up to the 1.0 mg marking like my prescription says. I'm turning the dose selector dial and it's clicking normally, getting up to 1.0, and then suddenly I hear this loud snap sound from inside the pen. Like something broke inside. Immediately after that, the dose selector knob started spinning freely, just rotating without any resistance at all. No more clicking, no stopping at the dose markings, it just spins and spins continuously like the internal mechanism that controls it has completely disconnected or broken. Now I can't set any dose because the selector isn't engaging with anything. I can spin it all day and nothing happens, it doesn't lock into any position. Clearly something snapped or broke inside that's critical to the dose selection mechanism. The pen is basically completely unusable now. I'd only had this pen for a week and was on my second dose from it when this happened. Brought it to the pharmacy and they agreed it's an internal mechanical failure. They documented the lot number and are sending the pen back to the manufacturer to investigate what failed inside. They gave me a replacement but I'm nervous about whether the replacement might have the same defect if this was a batch issue.",
