The gastroenterologist says the medication caused the rapid weight loss which led to the stones. I'm scheduled for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy next month to remove the gallbladder.",
        "reasoning": "The patient reports recurrent gallbladder pain, ultrasound evidence of sludge and small stones in the gallbladder, and a physician linking the rapid weight loss (likely from medication) to stone formation, culminating in scheduled surgical removal of the gallbladder. These findings pertain directly to pathology of the gallbladder.",

        "reasoning": "The patient describes a racing heart, elevated resting pulse (>100 bpm), jitteriness, and confirmed sinus tachycardia, which the doctor attributes to a side effect of Ozempic stimulating the heart.
