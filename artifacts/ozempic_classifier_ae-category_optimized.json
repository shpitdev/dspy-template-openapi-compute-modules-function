        "complaint": "Patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia. During induction, patient experienced regurgitation of gastric contents with subsequent aspiration despite documented 10-hour fast. Immediate endotracheal intubation performed with visualization of gastric material in oropharynx. Bronchoscopy performed showing aspirated material in right mainstem bronchus, which was suctioned. Post-operative chest x-ray demonstrated right lower lobe infiltrate consistent with aspiration. Patient transferred to ICU for close monitoring. Medication reconciliation revealed ongoing semaglutide use, last dose 3 days prior to surgery. Anesthesiology documentation notes GLP-1 receptor agonists should ideally be held 1-2 weeks before elective procedures due to delayed gastric emptying. Patient developed aspiration pneumonitis requiring antibiotics and extended hospital stay.",
        "reasoning": "The patient experienced regurgitation and aspiration of gastric contents during induction of general anesthesia, despite a documented 10\u2011hour fast. The presence of semaglutide (a GLP\u20111 receptor agonist) is known to delay gastric emptying, increasing the volume of gastric contents at the time of anesthesia and thereby elevating the risk of aspiration. The clinical course\u2014aspiration pneumonitis, infiltrate on chest X\u2011ray, ICU admission, and prolonged hospitalization\u2014directly reflects a peri\u2011procedural aspiration event precipitated by medication\u2011related delayed gastric emptying.",
        "classification": "Peri-procedural aspiration risk",
        "justification": "The adverse event is an aspiration that occurred during a surgical procedure, and the risk was heightened by the patient\u2019s use of semaglutide, which delays gastric emptying. This matches the \u201cPeri\u2011procedural aspiration risk\u201d category."

My doctor ordered an ultrasound and they found gallstones. The weird thing is I've lost about 30 pounds since I started on this medication back in like October, so I guess that's good, but now I have gallstones? Doctor said the rapid weight loss might be related. We're trying to figure out what to do next.",
        "reasoning": "The patient reports right upper quadrant pain after fatty meals, ultrasound-confirmed gallstones, and a history of rapid weight loss associated with medication use. These symptoms and findings are characteristic of gallbladder disease, specifically gallstone-related hepatobiliary pathology.",
