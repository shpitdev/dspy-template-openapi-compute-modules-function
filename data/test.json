    "complaint": "So I've been on Ozempic for about six months now, and I've been doing really well with my blood sugar and weight loss. I've lost about forty pounds, which is great. But about a month ago, I started having this really bad pain in my right upper abdomen. Like, really sharp pain, especially after I eat. It got worse and worse, I mean and finally I went to my doctor. They did an ultrasound and found gallstones. The doctor said I have cholelithiasis, and the stones are pretty large. I ended up needing surgery to remove my gallbladder. The surgeon said that rapid weight loss can cause gallstones, and since I've lost forty pounds in six months on the Ozempic, that's probably what caused it. so So it's not directly the medication, but the weight loss from the medication led to the gallstones. I'm doing okay after the surgery, but it was scary. I had to have laparoscopic surgery, which wasn't too bad, but still. I'm documenting this because even though it's indirect, the actually medication's effect caused a serious problem that required surgery.",

Last week, the patient was vomiting really severely, and they aspirated some of the vomit into their lungs. They ended up with aspiration pneumonia. They were hospitalized for five days on IV antibiotics. The patient also has GERD, which they've had for years, so that was a contributing factor. But the severe vomiting from the Ozempic definitely made the aspiration more likely. The patient is doing better now, but it was so a serious infection. I'm documenting this as an adverse event because the medication's side effects led to a serious complication requiring hospitalization.

I went to my cardiologist and he did  -  an EKG and found that I'm having episodes of atrial fibrillation. I've never had any heart problems before, no family history, nothing. The timing is suspicious because it started about a month after I began Ozempic. But I'm also under a lot of stress at work, and I've been drinking more coffee lately. So I mean I don't so know if it's the medication or something else. My cardiologist said it could be related to the , Ozempic, but he's not 100% sure.

I went to urgent care, and the doctor said it was an abscess. They had to do an incision and drainage procedure right there. It was really painful. They sent a culture, and it came back positive for . staph aureus. I had to take antibiotics for two weeks. The doctor asked me about my injection technique, and I've been following all the instructions - cleaning the site, using a new needle every uh time, everything. This has never happened with any other medication I've injected. well I'm really worried ... I mean about injecting again because I so don't want another infection.

I went to my doctor and she said it's telogen effluvium, which is hair loss that can happen after stress or major changes to your body. She thinks it's related to the rapid weight loss from the ... Ozempic. So it's not directly from the medication itself, but from the weight loss the uh medication causes. I'm really upset because I'm losing my hair, and it's affecting my self-esteem. I don't know if I should stop the medication, but my blood sugar is so much better. This is really affecting my quality of life.

He was admitted for three days, had to have an NG tube, IV fluids, the whole thing. Now, constipation is a known side well effect of Ozempic, and severe constipation can lead to bowel obstruction.
