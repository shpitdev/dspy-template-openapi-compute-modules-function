But then I started having terrible diarrhea. And I mean like 8-10 times a day, completely liquid, really urgent. Sorry if that's TMI. This went on for over a week and I was so dehydrated and weak. I also couldn't eat because I felt so nauseous, and I was afraid to eat because of the diarrhea. Finally I went to urgent care because I was feeling really out of it. They did blood work and said my kidney function was off - my creatinine was elevated, whatever that means. They gave me two bags of IV fluids and told me I needed to stop the Ozempic and see my regular doctor within a couple days. I did stop it and the diarrhea gradually got better over the next week. My doctor rechecked my kidney function and it's improving but still not back to normal. She said the dehydration from all the GI issues caused my kidneys to not work properly.",

They did blood tests and an ultrasound and the ER doctor said I have gallbladder inflammation - cholecystitis is what he called it. Said the gallbladder wall is thickened and there's fluid around it. They also found gallstones. I've been on Ozempic for about 7 months and have lost quite a bit of weight, like 40 pounds. The surgeon they called in said rapid weight loss is a known risk factor for gallbladder problems.

It's bad enough that I haven't been able to eat much at all, and a few times the pain has been so intense I threw up. Finally my wife insisted I go to the emergency room yesterday. They did blood work and a CT scan. The doctor said I have pancreatitis - inflammation of the pancreas. They asked if I drink alcohol and I said no, not really, maybe a beer on the weekend. They said I don't have gallstones. But I am on Ozempic, been taking it for like 5 or 6 months now. The doctor said the medication could be causing it and told me to stop taking it. They admitted me to the hospital and I'm not allowed to eat or drink anything, just getting fluids through an IV. They're giving me pain medication too which is helping a bit.",

She showed me the pictures and there's like bleeding in the back of my eye now and some new blood vessel growth that wasn't there before. She specifically asked if I had made any changes to my diabetes medications and I told her I started Ozempic about 4 months ago.

I've been taking Benadryl when it happens and that helps, but the rash still takes like a day or two to completely go away. I don't have any swelling or breathing problems, just the rash.

But lately I've been noticing my heart just racing sometimes for no reason. Like I'll be sitting on the couch watching TV and suddenly I can feel my heart pounding in my chest. It's kind of freaking me out to be honest. I checked my pulse a few times and it's been like 95, 98 beats per minute, which seems high when I'm just sitting there doing nothing. I used to be more in the 70s normally. Not sure if it's related to the medication or if I should be worried about something else.",
