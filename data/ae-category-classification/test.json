I was worried it might be infected so I sent a picture to my doctor through the patient portal. She had me come in the next day to check it out. She said it didn't look infected, just a significant local reaction to the medication. She cleaned the area, put some hydrocortisone cream on it, and told me to apply cold compresses.
