    "narrative": "Patient with longstanding type 2 diabetes and known moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy underwent ophthalmologic follow-up examination. Dilated fundoscopic exam revealed progression to severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy with extensive intraretinal hemorrhages, venous beading, and cotton wool spots bilaterally. Previous examination 4 months prior showed stable moderate disease. Interval history significant for initiation of semaglutide 12 weeks ago with marked improvement in glycemic control, HbA1c decreased from 9.2% to 6.8%. Retinal specialist notes this rapid improvement in glycemia is known risk factor for temporary worsening of retinopathy. Patient referred for consideration of panretinal photocoagulation. Discussed with patient that continued tight glucose control is essential despite temporary retinopathy worsening.",

    "narrative": "Okay so, um, I've been dealing with this really annoying rash that started maybe 6 or 7 hours after I took my third dose of this medication. It's all over my torso and arms, super itchy, kind of looks like mosquito bites but I know it's not because it's November and there aren't any mosquitos. I didn't have any breathing problems or swelling or anything scary like that, just this itchy rash. I took some Benadryl we had at home and it helped with the itching. Called my doctor the next day and they said it sounds like an allergic reaction. They want me to watch for it with my next dose and if it happens again, I'll probably need to switch to a different medication for my diabetes. Really hoping it doesn't happen again because this medication has been working really well for my blood sugar.",

They did an ultrasound and found out I have gallstones - multiple ones apparently. The ER doctor said that rapid weight loss can cause this, and I have lost a lot of weight since starting Ozempic, almost 35 pounds in five months. They gave me pain medication and told me I need to follow up with a surgeon to discuss having my gallbladder removed. For now they told me to stop the Ozempic and eat a low-fat diet.",

    "narrative": "I was scheduled for a routine upper endoscopy - they were checking for Barrett's esophagus because I have bad reflux - and I followed all the prep instructions. No food after midnight, only clear liquids until 4 hours before. But during the procedure, while I was sedated, I vomited and aspirated some of it. I don't remember any of this obviously because I was under sedation. But when I woke up the gastroenterologist was really concerned and explained what happened. She said I had a significant amount of retained gastric contents despite fasting appropriately. She asked about all my medications and when I told her about the Ozempic, she said that explains it. She said these medications can dramatically slow gastric emptying. They monitored me for several hours and did a chest x-ray to check for aspiration pneumonia. Thankfully it looked okay but they put me on antibiotics as a precaution. She said if I ever need another procedure with sedation, I need to stop the Ozempic at least a week beforehand.",

    "narrative": "My eye doctor sent me to see a retina specialist because she was concerned about changes she saw in my last eye exam. The specialist did a really comprehensive examination with all these different machines and scans. He said my diabetic retinopathy has progressed quite a bit since my last full evaluation which was about 6 months ago. There's some bleeding in the back of both eyes now and some new abnormal blood vessels growing. He said this is proliferative retinopathy and it needs to be treated. When he asked about my diabetes management, I told him I've been on Ozempic for about 4 months and my A1C has come down from 9.1 to 6.7, which I thought was great. He explained that sometimes when your blood sugar improves really quickly, the retinopathy can get worse before it gets better - it's called early worsening phenomenon or something like that. He scheduled me for laser treatment to prevent further damage and wants to see me monthly. I'm terrified about losing my vision.",

    "narrative": "Um, so I started getting this pain in my upper stomach area maybe a week ago. At first I thought it was just heartburn or indigestion, you know? But it kept getting worse and worse. The pain is constant and it's pretty severe - like an 8 out of 10. It also goes around to my back which is weird. I haven't been able to eat much because the pain gets worse when I eat, and I've thrown up a few times. My wife finally insisted I go to the ER last night. They did a bunch of tests - blood work, a CT scan. The doctor said my pancreas is inflamed and I have something called pancreatitis. The blood tests showed really high levels of these enzymes from my pancreas. They asked about alcohol and I told them I barely drink, maybe a beer once a month. They said I don't have gallstones. But when they asked about medications, I mentioned the Ozempic I've been taking for about 4 months. The doctor said that could definitely be the cause. They admitted me to the hospital, said I can't eat or drink anything for now, just getting IV fluids and pain meds. They told me to stop taking the Ozempic.",

    "narrative": "I've had diabetes for a long time and I've always been really careful about my eye health because I know diabetic eye disease is serious. I've been getting regular eye exams and my retinopathy has been stable for years - just mild background changes, nothing major. But at my most recent visit the ophthalmologist seemed concerned. He said there's been progression and now I have moderate to severe changes with some bleeding in the retina. He took pictures to compare to my previous visits and the difference was pretty stark. He asked if anything had changed with my diabetes management and I told him I started Ozempic about 5 months ago and my blood sugars have improved dramatically - my A1C went from 9.3 to 6.9. He said that paradoxically, when your blood sugar improves too quickly it can cause the retinopathy to temporarily worsen. He called it early worsening phenomenon. He wants to do laser treatment to protect my vision and see me much more frequently now. I'm really worried and wondering if I should have stuck with my old medications even if my sugars were higher.",

It also kind of radiates around to my back which is weird. Finally went to the emergency room yesterday because it was getting unbearable. They did blood tests and some kind of scan. The doctor said my pancreas enzymes are really high and that I have pancreatitis. He asked about alcohol use and gallstones - I don't drink much and they said I don't have stones. But I am on this Ozempic for my diabetes, been taking it for about 6 months. The doctor said that could be the cause and told me to stop taking it.

Anyway, I did the injection on Sunday morning before church and everything seemed fine at first. But then like an hour later I started feeling itchy all over. At first I thought maybe it was my new laundry detergent or something. But then I looked in the mirror and I had these red welts all over my chest and neck and arms. My husband said they looked like hives. I took some Benadryl and it helped a bit with the itching. Called the on-call nurse and she said to monitor it and if I had any trouble breathing or my throat felt tight to call 911. Thankfully it didn't get that bad, but the hives lasted for like two days.

And my throat felt like it was getting tight, which really scared me. My roommate drove me to the emergency room and they gave me epinephrine and some other medications through an IV. They kept me there for like 4 or 5 hours to make sure I was okay. The doctor said it was a serious allergic reaction and I absolutely cannot take Ozempic anymore.
