When I examined the pens themselves through their sealed packaging, the cartons and pens looked normal, but that chemical odor was concerning. I'm worried that maybe the pens were exposed to some kind of cleaning chemical during storage or shipping, or that there was a spill of some kind in the warehouse that contaminated the packaging. Even though the medication is sealed inside the pen cartridge, I don't feel comfortable using product that was shipped in packaging that has such a strong chemical smell. What if whatever chemical caused that smell somehow penetrated the packaging or contaminated the exterior surfaces? I'd be handling those surfaces when preparing my injection. Called the mail order pharmacy customer service and after describing the smell, they agreed to send a replacement shipment and have me return the odorous one.

As soon as I opened the package, I knew something was off. All the labeling is in French only, no English at all. The box design looks similar to Ozempic packaging but the colors and layout are slightly different from what I'm used to. The color scheme doesn't match the FDA-approved packaging I've seen before. I tried looking up the NDC number online and it returns no results in the US database - like the code doesn't exist in our system. My regular pharmacist looked at it and immediately said this is likely diverted product from the Canadian market that's not approved for sale in the US. Different packaging, different regulatory approval, possibly different manufacturing standards or quality oversight. Or it could be not authentic made to look like Canadian product. Either way, she strongly advised not to use it and to report the seller. The medication came from an unauthorized distribution channel and doesn't meet US regulatory requirements.

Like I hadn't taken anything at all. So I ended up dialing another 0.5 mg dose and taking it again, and same thing - too quick, too easy, no effect. By the end of the day I had dialed and injected the 0.5 mg dose three times total, thinking maybe it wasn't delivering properly or I was doing something wrong. But I'm experienced with this medication, I know how it should feel and work. My concern is that this particular pen might have diluted medication or incorrect concentration. Like maybe the active ingredient amount is lower than it should be. Otherwise why would I feel absolutely nothing after three doses when one dose normally has a clear effect?

I drove back to the pharmacy and explained the situation to the pharmacist, and she was nice enough to photocopy the instruction leaflet from another box they had in stock so at least I'd have something to reference.

Batch numbers are supposed to be unique identifiers for traceability purposes. If there's a recall or quality issue, you need to be able to identify exactly which batch a product came from.

When I opened the case and looked at the pens, I could see that the solution was partially frozen - there were visible ice crystals inside the cartridge when I held it up to the window. I brought them inside and let them thaw completely at room temperature. Once thawed, the solution looks clear again and the ice crystals are gone, but I know from the storage instructions that Ozempic should never be frozen. Even if it looks normal after thawing, freezing can denature the protein and make the medication ineffective or unreliable. I called my doctor's office and the nurse confirmed I need to throw these pens away and get new ones. Can't use medication that's been frozen even though it looks okay now.

Like it had been peeled back or never fully sealed in the first place. You could actually see the edge of the pen through the gap in the seal. Between the loose outer wrapper and the compromised inner seal, the product integrity is really questionable. There's no way to be certain that this pen hasn't been tampered with, contaminated, or exposed to conditions it shouldn't have been.
