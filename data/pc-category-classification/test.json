    "narrative": "Had a really frustrating experience with my injection this morning. I got everything ready, dialed up my usual 0.5 mg dose, attached a brand new needle like always, and started the injection. But as soon as I pressed the button, I felt wetness on my skin where the needle was. Looked down and sure enough, there's medication dripping out from around the needle hub area, not going into my skin like it should. I could see drops forming on the outside of the pen near where the needle attaches. Didn't feel right at all. So I stopped, removed the needle, cleaned everything up, got out a completely new needle from the package thinking maybe the first one wasn't seated properly, attached it carefully, made sure it was tight, and tried again. Same exact problem. More leaking around the needle connection. At this point I have no idea how much medication actually went in versus how much leaked out. The seal where the needle screws onto the pen just doesn't seem to be working correctly. Called the pharmacy and they said to bring in the pen, which I did. They're replacing it but now I'm not sure if I got my full dose today or not.",

    "narrative": "I had a scary medical experience after my injection yesterday that makes me think something might be wrong with this pen. I injected my full 1 mg dose exactly as prescribed, right after breakfast like I always do. I had eaten a normal meal, wasn't doing anything different from my usual routine. But within just a few hours, I started feeling really weird - shaky, sweaty, confused. Checked my blood glucose and it had dropped to 58 mg/dL. That's hypoglycemia, lower than it's ever been. This has never happened to me before with Ozempic. I'm not on any other diabetes medications that would cause low blood sugar. I had to eat fast-acting carbs to bring my glucose back up and I felt off for the rest of the day. I still have the pen and when I look at it, the solution appears clear and normal, but I'm concerned that maybe this particular pen has a higher concentration of active ingredient than what's labeled. Like maybe instead of 1 mg per dose, it's actually delivering more. That would explain the unexpectedly severe effect and the hypoglycemia. I contacted my doctor's office and the nurse said to stop using that pen immediately and bring it in. They're going to send it to the manufacturer for potency testing. If the concentration is higher than labeled, that's a serious quality control issue that could cause dangerous overdoses. They want to make sure this isn't a batch problem affecting other pens.",

It's hard to describe exactly, but kind of like a rotten or fermented smell, definitely not normal. Ozempic pens have never had any noticeable odor before in my experience. The solution inside looks clear when I examine it, no obvious particles or discoloration, but that smell is really concerning. I thought maybe I was imagining it, so I had my spouse smell it too and they agreed there's definitely an unusual odor coming from the pen. A rotten or off smell from a medication could indicate microbial contamination or that the product has degraded or spoiled somehow. Even though it's been stored properly in my refrigerator and isn't expired, something is clearly wrong. I absolutely cannot inject this into my body when there's an abnormal smell like that. It's not worth the risk. Contacted the pharmacy right away and described the smell. They said to bring the pen in immediately and not to use it under any circumstances. They're treating this as a potential contamination issue and are expediting a report to the manufacturer. They gave me a replacement pen from a completely different lot and I inspected that one very carefully - no unusual smell, appears normal.

Yesterday was my injection day, so I dialed up my usual 0.5 mg dose on the pen and did the injection. But it felt different than normal - the injection was over really quickly, much faster than usual, and it felt too easy, like there wasn't the usual resistance. At first I thought maybe I just imagined it, but then over the next 24 hours I didn't feel any of the usual effects of the medication. No appetite suppression, no GI effects, nothing. Like I hadn't taken anything at all. So I ended up dialing another 0.5 mg dose and taking it again, and same thing - too quick, too easy, no effect. By the end of the day I had dialed and injected the 0.5 mg dose three times total, thinking maybe it wasn't delivering properly or I was doing something wrong. But I'm experienced with this medication, I know how it should feel and work. My concern is that this particular pen might have diluted medication or incorrect concentration. Like maybe the active ingredient amount is lower than it should be. Otherwise why would I feel absolutely nothing after three doses when one dose normally has a clear effect? I kept the pen and brought it to the pharmacy.

I tried gently rolling and swirling the pen like the instructions say to do if you see anything unusual, but the particles didn't dissolve or go away. They just moved around a bit and then settled back at the bottom again. The solution in the upper portion of the cartridge above these particles appears clear and normal, but having any kind of undissolved crystals or precipitate is not normal. I've been using Ozempic for almost a year now and I've never seen anything like this in my previous pens - they've always been completely clear throughout with no particles or crystals. This looks like either the medication has started to crystallize or precipitate out of solution, which would indicate some kind of stability or formulation problem. Obviously I'm not using this pen. Contacted the pharmacy and they agreed that crystallization or particles that won't redissolve is abnormal and the pen should be returned to the manufacturer for analysis.

I drove back to the pharmacy because I needed to make sure what I actually have, and the pharmacist was surprised too. She checked their system and my prescription is definitely for 1 mg, and the carton NDC number matches the 1 mg product, but the pen inside is clearly labeled 0.5 mg.

There's no way I can use four pens in two weeks when I'm only supposed to take one dose per week. By my calculation, I'll use maybe one pen, possibly start the second one, but then at least two of these pens, probably three, will expire before I can even use them. That's a complete waste of medication and money. Called the pharmacy to explain the problem and ask for replacement pens with longer dating. They checked with their inventory system and their wholesaler, and basically said this is what they received and they don't have any better-dated stock available right now. Their wholesaler apparently sent them short-dated product and they can't replace it. This is really poor inventory management somewhere in the distribution chain.

The pharmacist said this shouldn't have made it into the US distribution channel with Spanish-only labeling.

The only way that makes sense is if it contaminated the solution during the manufacturing or filling process - like maybe it came off someone's clothing or from the manufacturing environment. This represents a complete sterility breach. This solution is supposed to be sterile for injection and there's a textile fiber floating in it. That's unacceptable.

The tracking said delivery would be between 10 AM and 2 PM, but the driver didn't actually show up until almost 6 PM, and when I opened the door to get the package, the driver was just leaving it on the ground and walking away. No temperature controlled vehicle or anything - the package had clearly been sitting in his regular delivery van all day. And this is late June, we've had record high temperatures this week, probably hitting close to 100 degrees today. The package was warm to the touch when I picked it up, and when I opened it, the gel ice packs that were supposed to keep it cool were completely melted and actually warm. The temperature monitoring sticker inside showed clear evidence of prolonged heat exposure - showed temperatures had exceeded safe limits. There's absolutely no way this medication maintained proper refrigeration during delivery. Between sitting in a hot delivery van all day and then being exposed to the heat during delayed delivery, these pens have been subjected to hours of high temperature exposure that definitely exceeds storage specifications.

They need to use refrigerated vehicles or at minimum ensure deliveries happen within reasonable timeframes, especially during hot weather.",

    "narrative": "This was honestly pretty scary when it happened. I was doing my usual weekly injection this morning, everything was set up normally, dose dialed, needle attached. I started the injection, pressed the button down, and suddenly I heard this cracking sound - kind of like a snap. Immediately felt the needle hub area get loose or wobbly. When I looked down, the plastic hub where the needle attaches to the pen had actually broken or separated. I carefully tried to pull the pen away from my skin like you're supposed to, but the needle itself stayed stuck in my skin while the pen pulled away. The needle had detached from the hub and was just sitting there in my injection site. I had to very carefully pull just the needle out manually, which I was not prepared to do. Thankfully it came out okay and didn't break under the skin or anything, but my hands were shaking afterward. Called the pharmacy right away and they had me come in to document everything and check the injection site. The pen clearly has some kind of structural failure at the needle attachment point. This could have been much worse if the needle had broken off completely under the skin. The manufacturer needs to know about this defect because it's a serious safety issue.",

    "reasoning": "Breakage at the hub and retention of needle indicates device integrity failure."
