I attached the needle, did the priming procedure, turned the dial to release the air and prime it, heard the clicking sound like it's supposed to make, but then nothing. No drop appeared at the needle tip at all. So I thought maybe it was the needle, took it off, put on a brand new one from the pack, tried again. Same thing. Clicked, but no medication came out. I probably tried this about five or six times with two different needles and I'm getting nowhere. The mechanism inside seems to be working - I can hear the clicks, the dial turns, but it's like the medication just won't flow through. Something must be blocked inside the pen. I called the pharmacy and they said this shouldn't happen and to bring it back for a replacement. Really frustrating because I was supposed to start my treatment today and now I have to wait.",

The package was delivered yesterday afternoon while I was at work - it was left on my front porch at around one PM according to the delivery timestamp. I didn't get home until almost seven PM, so it had been sitting out there for about six hours. And yesterday was brutal - we had a heat advisory with temperatures over 95 degrees, and my porch gets direct sun all afternoon. When I picked up the package it felt warm, definitely not cool like refrigerated medication should be. Inside, the gel ice pack that's supposed to keep it cold was completely melted, just warm liquid at that point. And there was one of those temperature indicator strips on the inner packaging, and it clearly showed that the product had been exposed to high temperatures for an extended period. The indicator was red or orange, I forget exactly which, but either way it means the temperature got too high. According to the information sheet, this medication is supposed to stay refrigerated and prolonged heat exposure can make it ineffective or degraded. I called the mail order pharmacy customer service and after being on hold forever, they agreed to send a replacement overnight, but this is a waste of medication and it's concerning that their shipping methods allow this to happen. They need better insulated packaging or refrigerated shipping options, especially for summer deliveries.",

But when I did the injection, something felt different. The plunger movement seemed to go on longer than usual, and there was this unusual resistance that I hadn't felt before. The whole injection took maybe twice as long as it normally does. I thought maybe I was just imagining things, but over the next few hours I started feeling really off - more nauseous than I've ever been on this medication, kind of shaky, just not right at all. Called my doctor's office and the nurse had me come in. My blood sugar was lower than expected and she was concerned that maybe I got more than the 0.25 mg dose I dialed. Like maybe the pen delivered more medication than what was showing on the dose selector. I had to monitor my blood sugar closely for the next day or so. I still have the pen and I'm afraid to use it again. The pharmacy is having me return it to send to the manufacturer for testing because if the dosing mechanism is off, that's a serious safety issue.

Red flag number one, I know. But they were offering it for much cheaper than my copay, and they claimed to be based overseas where the regulations are different. Against my better judgment, I ordered from them. The pens arrived after five weeks - no tracking, no temperature control packaging, just showed up one day in my mailbox. When I opened it and looked at the product, so many things were wrong. The carton has multiple spelling errors in the text - like medication spelled wrong, instructions with grammar problems. The pen cap is this weird off-blue color, not the proper shade it should be. And when I held up the pen to check the solution, it has a faint yellowish tint instead of being crystal clear. My regular pharmacist took one look at it and said it's obviously counterfeit or diverted product. No legitimate pharmacy sells prescription medication without a prescription. No real manufacturer has misspellings on their packaging. The wrong cap color, the discolored solution - all signs of fake product. I'm out the money I paid, and I'm reporting this to the FDA because other people are probably falling for the same scam.

So the outside box says one strength and the actual device says a different strength. That's not supposed to happen, right? I drove back to the pharmacy because I needed to make sure what I actually have, and the pharmacist was surprised too. She checked their system and my prescription is definitely for 1 mg, and the carton NDC number matches the 1 mg product, but the pen inside is clearly labeled 0.5 mg.

I immediately drove back to the pharmacy and asked them about it. The pharmacist seemed surprised and apologetic, pulled up the receiving records, and said it arrived that way from their wholesaler. The whole batch or shipment apparently had issues with the tamper-evident seals already being compromised before it got to the pharmacy. She showed me other boxes from the same shipment and several of them had broken seals too. They documented everything and reported it up the chain, and obviously gave me a replacement from a different lot that had proper intact seals.

Looked down and sure enough, there's medication dripping out from around the needle hub area, not going into my skin like it should. I could see drops forming on the outside of the pen near where the needle attaches. Didn't feel right at all. So I stopped, removed the needle, cleaned everything up, got out a completely new needle from the package thinking maybe the first one wasn't seated properly, attached it carefully, made sure it was tight, and tried again. Same exact problem. More leaking around the needle connection. At this point I have no idea how much medication actually went in versus how much leaked out.

So the pharmacy's system thought they were dispensing 2 mg and that's what they labeled it as, but the actual product in the bag is 1 mg. This is a potentially serious medication error - if I hadn't noticed and had taken my prescribed 2 mg dose using the 1 mg pen thinking it was the right strength, I would have been underdosed. That could affect my blood sugar control and the therapeutic effects I'm supposed to be getting. I immediately went back to the pharmacy to correct this error. The pharmacist apologized profusely and said they must have grabbed the wrong product from the shelf when filling my prescription. Their barcode scanning system should have caught the mismatch, but apparently it didn't.

I take one dose per week, so with a nine-day window I can maybe use one dose before these pens expire. That's it. The rest will be wasted. This is expensive medication and my insurance doesn't cover wastage like this. When I called the pharmacy to complain, they said this is all they have in stock and can't get better-dated product right now. But here's the thing - this is the second time this has happened with this same pharmacy in the past few months. The last time they gave me pens with only two weeks until expiry, and I told them then that this was a problem. Clearly they're not managing their inventory properly, probably ordering more than they can dispense and then pushing the old stock out to patients before it expires.

The plunger barely seemed to move, like the injection was over really quick. When I looked at the dose counter after removing the needle, it had only decreased by maybe 0.1 mg worth, definitely not the full 0.5 mg I had dialed. So either the medication didn't come out, or there's something wrong with the mechanism. I ended up having to dial another 0.4 mg or so and inject again, then check, and had to do this like three or four times total before it finally seemed like I'd gotten the full dose. This is very concerning because I have no idea if I'm actually getting accurate dosing from this pen. Is it under-delivering each time? Is the plunger movement indicator broken but the dose is actually correct? I can't tell, and that's a safety issue.

I'm really concerned about whether the internal mechanism might be damaged too, or if the cartridge seal is compromised. This is an injectable medication so integrity is really important. There's no way I'm using this pen when it's been subjected to that kind of physical trauma. I called the mail order pharmacy right away and they're sending a replacement overnight, but they said I need to send back the damaged one with photos for their quality records.

    "narrative": "Had my Ozempic delivered by courier service today and the delivery experience was terrible from a temperature control standpoint. The tracking said delivery would be between 10 AM and 2 PM, but the driver didn't actually show up until almost 6 PM, and when I opened the door to get the package, the driver was just leaving it on the ground and walking away. No temperature controlled vehicle or anything - the package had clearly been sitting in his regular delivery van all day. And this is late June, we've had record high temperatures this week, probably hitting close to 100 degrees today. The package was warm to the touch when I picked it up, and when I opened it, the gel ice packs that were supposed to keep it cool were completely melted and actually warm. The temperature monitoring sticker inside showed clear evidence of prolonged heat exposure - showed temperatures had exceeded safe limits. There's absolutely no way this medication maintained proper refrigeration during delivery. Between sitting in a hot delivery van all day and then being exposed to the heat during delayed delivery, these pens have been subjected to hours of high temperature exposure that definitely exceeds storage specifications. I refused to accept the delivery and made the driver take it back, then called the mail order pharmacy to file a complaint about their delivery service.

When I turn the dose selector dial to set my dose, the mechanism is working - the dial turns and the dose counter advances properly - but something doesn't sound or feel right. The internal mechanism is making these grinding or clicking sounds that are much louder than I'm used to hearing. My previous pens have always been smooth and quiet when turning the dial, maybe a subtle click but nothing loud. This one sounds rough, almost like gears grinding against each other or something. And it doesn't just sound different, it feels different too. There's more resistance when turning, and the motion isn't smooth - it's kind of rough and catches slightly as you turn it. I compared it to an older pen I still have and the difference is really noticeable. I'm worried that whatever is causing this abnormal sound and rough operation is going to get worse and the mechanism might fail completely mid-way through using the pen. Like maybe some internal gear or component is wearing down or misaligned. I can still use it for now since the dose counter is advancing correctly, but I'm keeping a close eye on it and I contacted the pharmacy to let them know.

It's not in the solution itself - the solution appears clear - but you can see it on the inside wall of the glass. Looks like some kind of residue or discoloration that formed a ring around the inside circumference. At first I thought maybe it was just a reflection or something on the outside of the glass, but when I look carefully and turn the pen, it's definitely on the inner surface. Both pens from the same carton have this same marking. My previous pens from other batches never had any marks or discoloration on the glass at all. The cartridge glass has always been perfectly clear inside and out. I'm concerned this could be residue from the filling process, or discoloration from the medication degrading and depositing something on the glass, or maybe even contamination.

The solution was actually partially frozen - I could see it wasn't fully solid but definitely had ice in it. I took it out and let it thaw at room temperature for a few hours, and now the solution looks clear again, no crystals or anything visible. Called the pharmacist to ask if it's still safe to use and she said absolutely not, that freezing the medication destroys it and I need to throw it away and get a new one.

Ordered three pens, paid through some payment system I wasn't familiar with, and waited. The pens showed up after about three weeks. At first glance the packaging looks pretty genuine - has the Novo Nordisk branding, the blue pens, all of that. But when I started looking more closely, some things didn't add up. I tried scanning the 2D barcode on the box with my phone using the manufacturer's verification app, and it gave me an error message. Wouldn't scan properly or verify. Then I went to the Novo Nordisk website where they have that verification portal where you can enter the lot number, and when I put in the lot number from my pens, the system said it cannot find that lot number in their database. Like it doesn't exist in their records. And when I looked really carefully at the holographic security seal on the carton, it seems slightly misaligned or crooked, not perfectly applied like I'd expect from a professional pharmaceutical manufacturer. I showed all this to my regular pharmacist and she said these are almost certainly counterfeit and I absolutely should not use them.

I tried twisting, pulling, using a rubber grip, nothing worked. It was stuck on there incredibly tight. Eventually I had to get a pair of pliers from my toolbox and use those to grip the cap and twist it off, which should obviously not be necessary for a medical device. But here's the problem - when I applied the force needed with the pliers to get the cap off, I heard a small cracking sound and now there's a visible hairline crack in the clear plastic pen body near the window where you see the solution. I'm really concerned that the excessive force required to remove the cap may have damaged the internal mechanism or compromised the seal integrity of the cartridge. Can I still safely use this pen or is the crack going to affect how it works or potentially cause leakage?

And this is August, we're having temperatures in the high 80s and 90s every day. I checked the tracking information and the package was in transit for three full days from the distribution center to my house. Three days of unrefrigerated shipping in summer heat. There wasn't even a temperature monitoring indicator included to show whether it got too hot. How am I supposed to know if this medication is still good or if it's been sitting at 90 degrees for three days and is now degraded?

I made sure to keep the lot sticker from the box so they can track which batch this came from. I'm glad I checked before injecting because who knows what's going on with that solution.",

    "narrative": "I received my Ozempic shipment from the mail order pharmacy and when I opened the insulated shipping container, I was hit with this strong chemical smell that definitely shouldn't be there. It smelled kind of like rubbing alcohol or disinfectant, really pungent and unpleasant. The smell was coming from inside the package, not from the outside box. When I examined the pens themselves through their sealed packaging, the cartons and pens looked normal, but that chemical odor was concerning. I'm worried that maybe the pens were exposed to some kind of cleaning chemical during storage or shipping, or that there was a spill of some kind in the warehouse that contaminated the packaging. Even though the medication is sealed inside the pen cartridge, I don't feel comfortable using product that was shipped in packaging that has such a strong chemical smell. What if whatever chemical caused that smell somehow penetrated the packaging or contaminated the exterior surfaces? I'd be handling those surfaces when preparing my injection. Called the mail order pharmacy customer service and after describing the smell, they agreed to send a replacement shipment and have me return the odorous one. They said they'd investigate whether there was a contamination incident in their distribution center. Better safe than sorry with something like this.",
