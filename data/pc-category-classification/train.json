I've tried looking at it in bright light, in sunlight, with my reading glasses, and there are just no numbers showing. The pen otherwise seems to function - the dial turns and clicks like it should, the solution looks clear and normal - but I have absolutely no way to verify what dose I'm setting or confirm how many doses are left in the pen. The dose counter is a critical safety feature because you need to know you're getting the right amount of medication and track when the pen will be empty. Without being able to see the numbers, I can't safely use this pen. I don't know if the printing somehow got missed during manufacturing, or if there's an internal mechanism that's supposed to display the numbers that's broken.

My previous pens have always been smooth and quiet when turning the dial, maybe a subtle click but nothing loud. This one sounds rough, almost like gears grinding against each other or something. And it doesn't just sound different, it feels different too. There's more resistance when turning, and the motion isn't smooth - it's kind of rough and catches slightly as you turn it. I compared it to an older pen I still have and the difference is really noticeable. I'm worried that whatever is causing this abnormal sound and rough operation is going to get worse and the mechanism might fail completely mid-way through using the pen. Like maybe some internal gear or component is wearing down or misaligned. I can still use it for now since the dose counter is advancing correctly, but I'm keeping a close eye on it and I contacted the pharmacy to let them know.

It's not in the solution itself - the solution appears clear - but you can see it on the inside wall of the glass. Looks like some kind of residue or discoloration that formed a ring around the inside circumference. At first I thought maybe it was just a reflection or something on the outside of the glass, but when I look carefully and turn the pen, it's definitely on the inner surface. Both pens from the same carton have this same marking. My previous pens from other batches never had any marks or discoloration on the glass at all. The cartridge glass has always been perfectly clear inside and out. I'm concerned this could be residue from the filling process, or discoloration from the medication degrading and depositing something on the glass, or maybe even contamination.

And this is August, we're having temperatures in the high 80s and 90s every day. I checked the tracking information and the package was in transit for three full days from the distribution center to my house. Three days of unrefrigerated shipping in summer heat. There wasn't even a temperature monitoring indicator included to show whether it got too hot. How am I supposed to know if this medication is still good or if it's been sitting at 90 degrees for three days and is now degraded?

She tried using both thumbs pressing together as hard as she could, and it barely moves. I tried it myself and yes, it's much stiffer than it should be. The button should depress smoothly with moderate pressure, but this one seems to have some kind of mechanical problem that's making it almost impossible to push.

But when I did the injection, something felt different. The plunger movement seemed to go on longer than usual, and there was this unusual resistance that I hadn't felt before. The whole injection took maybe twice as long as it normally does. I thought maybe I was just imagining things, but over the next few hours I started feeling really off - more nauseous than I've ever been on this medication, kind of shaky, just not right at all. Called my doctor's office and the nurse had me come in. My blood sugar was lower than expected and she was concerned that maybe I got more than the 0.25 mg dose I dialed. Like maybe the pen delivered more medication than what was showing on the dose selector. I had to monitor my blood sugar closely for the next day or so. I still have the pen and I'm afraid to use it again. The pharmacy is having me return it to send to the manufacturer for testing because if the dosing mechanism is off, that's a serious safety issue.

But after I release pressure on the button, it doesn't spring back up to its original position like it's supposed to. Instead, it stays stuck down in the depressed position. Now I can't dial up my next dose because the button needs to be in the up position before the dose selector will turn, and it's stuck down. This happened after only my second dose from a brand new pen, which means there should be four more doses remaining that I now can't access. I've tried gently pulling on the button to see if it would pop back up, but it won't budge. There's clearly something wrong with the spring mechanism or whatever internal component is supposed to make the button reset after each injection. The pen is basically useless now after only two uses. Brought it to the pharmacy and they confirmed it's a device malfunction with the button reset mechanism.

The package was delivered yesterday afternoon while I was at work - it was left on my front porch at around one PM according to the delivery timestamp. I didn't get home until almost seven PM, so it had been sitting out there for about six hours. And yesterday was brutal - we had a heat advisory with temperatures over 95 degrees, and my porch gets direct sun all afternoon. When I picked up the package it felt warm, definitely not cool like refrigerated medication should be. Inside, the gel ice pack that's supposed to keep it cold was completely melted, just warm liquid at that point. And there was one of those temperature indicator strips on the inner packaging, and it clearly showed that the product had been exposed to high temperatures for an extended period. The indicator was red or orange, I forget exactly which, but either way it means the temperature got too high. According to the information sheet, this medication is supposed to stay refrigerated and prolonged heat exposure can make it ineffective or degraded. I called the mail order pharmacy customer service and after being on hold forever, they agreed to send a replacement overnight, but this is a waste of medication and it's concerning that their shipping methods allow this to happen.

It's definitely not normal - it looks almost pasty or gel-like, not like the clear liquid solution. I tried gently rolling the pen between my palms like the instructions say to do if you see particles, thinking maybe it would mix back in and dissolve. But even after rolling it for several minutes, the sediment stays clumped at the bottom. It doesn't redissolve or disperse back into the solution. The rest of the solution in the upper portion of the cartridge looks perfectly normal and clear, but this sediment at the bottom is just sitting there. The pen has been properly refrigerated the whole time - I keep my fridge temp between 36 and 40 degrees like you're supposed to. This isn't from improper storage on my end. It looks like the protein in the solution has separated out or aggregated or something. That's a sign of degradation, right? Obviously not using this pen.

This is completely unexpected and honestly quite scary for an injectable medication that's supposed to be sterile. How does metal get into a sealed pharmaceutical cartridge?

I immediately called the pharmacy and spoke to the pharmacist who dispensed them. She was apologetic and said it was a system error. Apparently this lot should have been flagged as expired and pulled from their active inventory, but somehow it got missed. The stock was supposedly quarantined in their system, meaning it shouldn't have been available for dispensing, but clearly something failed in their inventory controls and the expired pens got dispensed to me anyway. This is a critical failure in both inventory management and quality control. Expired medication could be less effective, potentially unsafe, and definitely shouldn't be given to patients.

I could see drops of liquid forming at the connection point and dripping down. Probably lost about six drops before I realized what was happening and pulled the needle off. I thought maybe the needle wasn't seated properly or I'd done something wrong, so I very carefully removed it, made sure the rubber seal area was clean, got a brand new needle from the package, and screwed it on very carefully, making sure it was tight. Tried again, and the same thing happened - more leaking around the seal. The rubber seal that's supposed to create a watertight connection between the needle and the pen is either damaged or improperly formed. The seal should prevent any leakage, but clearly it's not working. With medication leaking out before I can even inject, I have no way to ensure accurate dosing.

Opened it up and the product carton inside was also dented pretty badly. The plastic tray that holds the pen was bent and when I took the pen out, it's rattling around loosely inside, like something is broken or disconnected. The green cap has a visible crack running down the side of it and doesn't stay on securely anymore. I'm really concerned about whether the internal mechanism might be damaged too, or if the cartridge seal is compromised. This is an injectable medication so integrity is really important. There's no way I'm using this pen when it's been subjected to that kind of physical trauma. I called the mail order pharmacy right away and they're sending a replacement overnight, but they said I need to send back the damaged one with photos for their quality records. It's frustrating because this is the second time I've had issues with their packaging and shipping methods. They need to use better protective packaging for fragile medical devices.",

Last week I was rushing to catch a flight and I put the case in my car trunk instead of bringing it into the house. Then I completely forgot about it. This happened to be during a cold snap we had, with overnight temperatures dropping down to around 20 degrees Fahrenheit. The pens were in my car trunk for three full days in subfreezing temperatures before I remembered and went to retrieve them. When I opened the case and looked at the pens, I could see that the solution was partially frozen - there were visible ice crystals inside the cartridge when I held it up to the window. I brought them inside and let them thaw completely at room temperature. Once thawed, the solution looks clear again and the ice crystals are gone, but I know from the storage instructions that Ozempic should never be frozen. Even if it looks normal after thawing, freezing can denature the protein and make the medication ineffective or unreliable. I called my doctor's office and the nurse confirmed I need to throw these pens away and get new ones. Can't use medication that's been frozen even though it looks okay now. So I'm out two pens because of my own mistake. Just documenting this in case anyone else accidentally freezes their medication - don't try to use it even after it thaws.",

Against my better judgment, I ordered from them. The pens arrived after five weeks - no tracking, no temperature control packaging, just showed up one day in my mailbox. When I opened it and looked at the product, so many things were wrong. The carton has multiple spelling errors in the text - like medication spelled wrong, instructions with grammar problems. The pen cap is this weird off-blue color, not the proper shade it should be. And when I held up the pen to check the solution, it has a faint yellowish tint instead of being crystal clear. My regular pharmacist took one look at it and said it's obviously counterfeit or diverted product. No legitimate pharmacy sells prescription medication without a prescription. No real manufacturer has misspellings on their packaging. The wrong cap color, the discolored solution - all signs of fake product.

The box design looks similar to Ozempic packaging but the colors and layout are slightly different from what I'm used to. The color scheme doesn't match the FDA-approved packaging I've seen before. I tried looking up the NDC number online and it returns no results in the US database - like the code doesn't exist in our system. My regular pharmacist looked at it and immediately said this is likely diverted product from the Canadian market that's not approved for sale in the US. Different packaging, different regulatory approval, possibly different manufacturing standards or quality oversight. Or it could be counterfeit made to look like Canadian product.

So the pharmacy's system thought they were dispensing 2 mg and that's what they labeled it as, but the actual product in the bag is 1 mg. This is a potentially serious medication error - if I hadn't noticed and had taken my prescribed 2 mg dose using the 1 mg pen thinking it was the right strength, I would have been underdosed. That could affect my blood sugar control and the therapeutic effects I'm supposed to be getting. I immediately went back to the pharmacy to correct this error. The pharmacist apologized profusely and said they must have grabbed the wrong product from the shelf when filling my prescription. Their barcode scanning system should have caught the mismatch, but apparently it didn't.

When I try to dial up my dose to 0.75 mg like I'm supposed to, the dose knob gets really stiff and jams right at that point. Won't turn any further no matter what I do. I have to use quite a bit of force to try to rotate it, and when I do manage to move it slightly, it just slips back to a lower number. I thought maybe I was just having an off day, so I tried again this morning with my reading glasses on to make sure I was doing it right - same problem. Then my next scheduled dose came up and I opened my second pen from the same box, and would you believe it's doing the exact same thing? Both pens from the same lot number are jamming at 0.75 mg. I can dial to 0.5 mg fine, but can't get to the dose I need. Called the manufacturer's help line and they're sending me a report form to fill out. Meanwhile I had to go back on my previous lower dose until I can get working pens. Both of these are from lot number XK4892.",

That's when I noticed that the rubber seal that's supposed to be under the cap, covering the pen tip, is completely missing. Just not there at all. The pen tip where you screw on the needle was totally exposed, no protective barrier covering it. That seal is supposed to be there to maintain sterility of the injection interface until you're ready to use the pen, and mine didn't have one. This seems like a serious sterility issue because that's the exact area where the needle attaches and where the medication comes out. If it was exposed during shipping and handling without that protective seal, there's no way to guarantee it's still sterile. I mean, any dust, bacteria, contaminants could have gotten on that surface. I absolutely cannot use this pen when the sterility of the injection point is compromised. Brought it back to the pharmacy immediately and they agreed this is a critical packaging component failure. They documented it thoroughly, gave me a replacement from a different lot that has the proper seal intact, and are sending the defective one back to the manufacturer. This kind of missing component is unacceptable for injectable medication packaging.",

    "narrative": "Had a frustrating experience trying to use my new pen for the first time. The green outer cap that covers the pen was on so tight that I literally could not remove it by hand. I tried twisting, pulling, using a rubber grip, nothing worked. It was stuck on there incredibly tight. Eventually I had to get a pair of pliers from my toolbox and use those to grip the cap and twist it off, which should obviously not be necessary for a medical device. But here's the problem - when I applied the force needed with the pliers to get the cap off, I heard a small cracking sound and now there's a visible hairline crack in the clear plastic pen body near the window where you see the solution. I'm really concerned that the excessive force required to remove the cap may have damaged the internal mechanism or compromised the seal integrity of the cartridge. Can I still safely use this pen or is the crack going to affect how it works or potentially cause leakage? The pharmacy said to bring it in and they'll replace it because a cap should never be that difficult to remove and requiring tools to open it is definitely an assembly or manufacturing defect. Makes me wonder if the cap was somehow cross-threaded or over-tightened during assembly.",

    "narrative": "This is an unfortunate situation caused by a delivery error that resulted in my medication being left unrefrigerated for way too long. I use a specialty pharmacy for my Ozempic and they shipped it via overnight delivery in an insulated package with ice packs like they're supposed to. The tracking showed it was out for delivery yesterday morning and marked as delivered at 10 AM. But I never received it. Turns out the courier mis-delivered it to my neighbor's house two doors down instead of mine. My neighbor has an enclosed front porch that isn't visible from the street, so they didn't notice the package sitting there until this morning when they were leaving for work. They brought it over to me, which was nice of them, but by then it had been sitting on their enclosed porch for almost two full days. When I felt the package, it was room temperature or even warmer - remember, it's been sitting in an enclosed porch for 48 hours. Opened it up and the ice packs were completely thawed, just bags of warm water at this point. Based on the timeline, this medication has been unrefrigerated in a warm environment for approximately 48 hours. The storage requirements say it needs to be refrigerated and shouldn't be exposed to temperatures above 86 degrees for extended periods. I have no idea what temperature it reached sitting in that enclosed porch, but it's definitely been compromised. Called the specialty pharmacy and they're sending a replacement at no charge, but this is a waste of medication due to a delivery error. They said I should not use the mis-delivered pens since the temperature excursion was so prolonged.",

It literally looks like diluted milk or a suspension of some kind. This is completely abnormal. I've been using Ozempic for six months now and all my previous pens have had perfectly clear, water-like solution with no color or cloudiness at all. To make sure I wasn't going crazy, I pulled out my almost-empty pen from last week and compared them side by side. The old pen is crystal clear and the new pen is definitely milky white. Both pens have been stored under identical conditions in my refrigerator at the proper temperature, so this isn't a storage issue on my end. A milky appearance in a solution that should be clear indicates either protein aggregation, where the medication molecules are clumping together, or possibly even microbial contamination. Either way, this is a critical quality issue. There's no way I'm injecting this into my body. I wrote down the lot number from the carton before I called the pharmacy. They agreed that milky white appearance is definitely abnormal and potentially dangerous. They're having me return the pen so it can be sent to the manufacturer's quality lab for investigation. They need to figure out what caused this appearance change and whether it's an isolated issue or if other pens from that batch are affected.",

No drop appeared at the needle tip at all. So I thought maybe it was the needle, took it off, put on a brand new one from the pack, tried again. Same thing. Clicked, but no medication came out. I probably tried this about five or six times with two different needles and I'm getting nowhere. The mechanism inside seems to be working - I can hear the clicks, the dial turns, but it's like the medication just won't flow through. Something must be blocked inside the pen. I called the pharmacy and they said this shouldn't happen and to bring it back for a replacement. Really frustrating because I was supposed to start my treatment today and now I have to wait.",

But when I look at the actual pen dose selector dial, the markings only show 0.5 mg and 1 mg dose options. There's no 0.25 mg marking anywhere on the dial that I can see. This is a major problem because my prescription specifically requires that I start at the lower 0.25 mg dose for the first four weeks as a titration period before increasing. If the pen doesn't have 0.25 mg markings, how am I supposed to take that dose? Did they package the wrong pen in this carton? Is the carton labeling wrong? I have no idea but the carton description and the actual device don't match up. I went back to the pharmacy to confirm I wasn't missing something, and the pharmacist looked at it and agreed there's definitely a mismatch - the carton says one thing and the pen shows another. She checked other pens in stock and they all had the correct dose markings that matched their cartons. So mine is some kind of labeling error or packaging mix-up.

Then I looked at the lot code on the carton and that font also seems inconsistent with what I'm used to seeing. The numbers look lighter or thinner somehow. Being suspicious at this point, I tried scanning the QR code with my phone to verify authenticity on the manufacturer's website like they tell you to do, and it's giving me an error message. Either the code isn't valid or it's not linking to the Novo Nordisk site like it should. I still have an empty pen from my last prescription and I compared them side by side - definitely differences in appearance.
