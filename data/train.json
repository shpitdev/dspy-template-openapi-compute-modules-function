    "complaint": "So, um, I need to report something about my patient. This is Dr. Sarah Chen calling from the internal medicine clinic. Patient is a 52-year-old woman, like she's been my patient for about three years now. She has type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and she's been struggling with her weight. Her A1C was running around 7.8, which isn't terrible but we wanted to get it lower. So about so a month ago, we decided to start her on Ozempic. It like was the 0.5 milligram dose, weekly injection. She was really excited about it, you know, because she'd heard all the success stories about weight loss and blood sugar control. Patient started Ozempic, you know it was the 0.5 milligram dose, weekly injection. This was about three weeks ago, maybe a little more. I want to say it was the first week of October, and now we're well at the end of October. So yeah, about three weeks. And after three weeks, they developed severe nausea and vomiting. Like, really severe. The patient called me you know on a Friday afternoon, and she sounded terrible. She said um she'd been vomiting since Wednesday, so for about two days straight. She couldn't keep anything down, not even water. She tried drinking small sips like of water, but even  -  that came right um back up. The patient called me, you know, in distress. She was really scared because she'd never experienced anything like this before. They were dehydrated, couldn't eat, lost about eight pounds in just a few days. I mean, I mean this is not normal weight loss, this is from the  -  vomiting. Eight pounds in three days is way too fast, and it's clearly from dehydration and not being able to eat. I advised them to stop the medication immediately and come in for evaluation. I told her to come to the clinic right away, but she was too weak to drive, so her husband brought actually her in. When she got here, she looked terrible - pale, weak, just really sick. We did labs, their electrolytes were off, they needed IV fluids. Her sodium was low, her potassium was low, her BUN and creatinine were elevated, which suggested dehydration. We started her on IV fluids right there in the clinic, and I sent her to the emergency room for more aggressive hydration. She ended up getting two liters of IV fluids in the ER, and they monitored her for a few hours. I mean This is clearly I mean an  -  adverse reaction to the Ozempic. The timing is too coincidental - started the medication, uh three weeks later, severe GI I mean symptoms. We've ruled out other causes. The patient had no history of GI issues before this. No food poisoning, no stomach flu going around, nothing. She hadn't changed her diet, actually hadn't started any other new medications. The only thing that changed was starting the Ozempic. I'm documenting this as an adverse event because it required uh medical intervention and the patient had to discontinue the medication. She's not going to continue with it, obviously. The  -  patient is doing better now that they've stopped, but it took about a week for the symptoms to fully resolve. She's back to her . baseline I mean now, but she's really shaken up by the whole experience. I'm concerned about trying other GLP-1 agonists with her because this reaction was so you know severe. We're going to have to find another approach to managing her diabetes and weight.",

They came in last week because they uh noticed, you know, a lump in their neck. Like, they were feeling around and found this hard  -  lump on the right side. So I examined them and found a thyroid nodule, it's about two centimeters. We did an ultrasound and, um, there are some concerning features. The radiologist said it has microcalcifications and irregular borders, which are, you know, red flags for malignancy. The patient is really worried, obviously. They're asking um if this could be related to the Ozempic. I mean, I know there's a black box warning about thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents, but in humans it's less clear. However, the timing ... is suspicious - they started Ozempic two months ago, and now we have this nodule. We're doing a fine needle aspiration next week to check for cancer.

I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, couldn't do anything. My wife made me go to the emergency room on Wednesday. They did blood work and my amylase was, like, 450, which they said is really high. Normal is under 100. And my lipase was also elevated. The ER doctor diagnosed me well with pancreatitis and admitted I mean me to the hospital. I was there for three days on IV fluids and pain meds. They did a CT scan um and confirmed it was pancreatitis. The doctors asked me about medications and when I told them about Ozempic, they said that could like definitely be the cause. I've never had so pancreatitis before, I don't drink alcohol, I don't have gallstones. The only thing that changed was starting this  -  medication. I'm really upset because I was doing well with my blood sugar, but now I'm scared well to take it again. The hospital doctor said I should definitely report this as an adverse event.",

She almost passed out when she stood up. So I checked her blood sugar right there in the office and it was 45 milligrams per deciliter. That's dangerously low. Normal is 70 to 100. She was diaphoretic, confused, shaky. you know I gave her glucose tablets immediately and her sugar came up to 85, but she was still symptomatic. I sent her to the emergency room because hypoglycemia that severe needs monitoring. She's on Ozempic and also metformin, but she's been on metformin for years without issues. The Ozempic is new, started about  -  six weeks ago. The patient said she's been eating less because of the nausea from Ozempic, which probably contributed, but the medication itself uh can cause hypoglycemia, especially when combined with other diabetes drugs.

Like, really swollen, probably uh three inches across. And it was hot well to touch and really painful. I put ice on it and took some ibuprofen, but it didn't help much. After a couple days, it started um oozing pus, which was gross. I called my doctor and they told me to come in. When I got there, the nurse practitioner said it looked , infected. She took a swab and started me on antibiotics. The culture came back positive for staph infection. I had to take oral antibiotics for ten days, and the infection finally cleared up, but it left a scar. The doctor said this could be from improper injection technique , or contamination, but I've been following the instructions exactly.

I have an EpiPen because I'm allergic to shellfish, so I used it immediately. My husband drove me to the emergency room.

He did a full exam and found that my diabetic retinopathy has gotten significantly worse. He said it's progressed from mild to moderate-severe in just a few months. There are new blood vessels forming, which is bad. He said this can happen when blood sugar drops too quickly - it's called the early worsening phenomenon. The rapid improvement in so my diabetes actually made my eye disease worse temporarily. I'm going to need laser treatment now, which I didn't need before.

I've always been a pretty happy person. But this was different - I felt hopeless, worthless, like there was no point to anything. I stopped wanting to do things I used to enjoy. I couldn't sleep, but I also couldn't get out of bed. And then, um, I started having thoughts about hurting myself. Like, really serious thoughts. I was planning how I would do  -  it. My wife noticed something was wrong and made me see my doctor. My doctor immediately sent me to the psychiatric emergency room. I was admitted to the psychiatric unit and stayed there for five days. They started me on antidepressants and stopped the Ozempic. The psychiatrist said this could be related well to the medication, though it's not common. I'm doing better now, but I'm still on antidepressants and seeing a therapist. I'm really scared this was caused by the Ozempic.

My actually name is Robert, I'm 48 years old, and I've been on Ozempic for about four months now. I um started it because I have type 2 diabetes and I was really struggling with my weight. so My doctor recommended it, and I was hopeful it um would help. The first couple of months were actually pretty good - I lost about fifteen pounds, my um blood sugar improved, I felt okay. But then about a month ago, I started having these weird episodes. Like, I'll be fine, sitting at my desk working, and then suddenly I'll get well really dizzy and lightheaded. My heart starts racing, and it I mean feels like my heart is well going to beat out of my chest. It's really scary when it happens. This happens maybe once or twice a week, usually in the afternoon, but sometimes in the evening like too. The episodes last maybe ten or fifteen minutes, and then I feel okay again, but really tired afterward. At first I thought maybe it was just stress or anxiety, but it kept happening. So I went to my cardiologist, Dr. Patel. He did an EKG, and he found actually that I'm having episodes of atrial fibrillation. That's when your heart beats irregularly. I've never had heart problems before, no family history of heart disease, nothing. I've always been pretty healthy, you know, other than the diabetes. The you know timing is suspicious because it started about a month after I began Ozempic. But here's the thing - I'm well also under a lot of stress at work. We've had some major projects going on, deadlines, that kind of thing. And . I've been drinking more coffee lately, like three or four cups a day, because I've been um feeling really fatigued since starting the Ozempic. The fatigue is another thing - I'm tired all the time, , which is weird because I'm sleeping okay. So I don't know if it's the medication, or the you know stress, or the caffeine, or some combination of all three. My cardiologist said it could be related to the medication, um but he's not 100% sure. He said there um are case I mean reports of GLP-1 agonists causing cardiac arrhythmias, but it's not super common. He started me on a beta blocker, metoprolol, which helps some - the episodes are less frequent and less intense - but I'm still having them. I'm still having episodes maybe once a week , now instead of twice. I'm documenting this because even though we're not certain it's the Ozempic, the timing suggests it could be related. And it's a serious enough problem that I think it needs to be reported.

Last week, I was vomiting pretty badly, and I guess I aspirated some of it ... into my lungs. I ended up with aspiration pneumonia. I was hospitalized for four days on IV antibiotics. The doctors said the vomiting from the Ozempic contributed to the aspiration. But I also have GERD, which I've had for years, so it's not like the Ozempic is the only factor. But the vomiting definitely made it actually worse. I'm better now, but it was scary.

So so it's not directly the medication causing the so gallstones, but the medication caused the weight loss which led to the gallstones.

Now, constipation is a known side effect of Ozempic, and severe constipation can lead to bowel obstruction.

If people can't read the expiration date, they might use expired medication, which could be ineffective or even dangerous. Or they might throw away good medication unnecessarily.

I'm worried I'm going to break it or something. I've used Ozempic pens before, and they were never this hard to turn. This is different from my previous pens - those were smooth and easy to dial. This one is really difficult. I'm concerned that if it's this hard to turn, maybe the mechanism . is broken or defective. What if it doesn't deliver the right dose because the like mechanism is stuck or damaged? I haven't used it yet because I'm worried about getting the wrong dose. I called my pharmacy and they're sending me a replacement, but I wanted to report this because this is a quality issue. The pen should work smoothly and easily.
