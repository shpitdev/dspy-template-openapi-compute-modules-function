Like, everywhere - arms, legs, trunk, everywhere. They also had a fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit. They came into my office, and I sent them for labs. Their liver enzymes were elevated - ALT was 180, AST was 150, which is significantly elevated. Normal is under 40. This looks like a systemic hypersensitivity reaction with organ involvement. The patient had no history of liver disease, no . other medications I mean that could cause this. The timing is very suspicious - second dose of Ozempic, and then this reaction. I stopped the medication immediately and started them on steroids. The rash is improving, but the liver enzymes are still elevated. This is a serious adverse drug uh reaction. I'm documenting this as an reported issue because it's a systemic hypersensitivity reaction with organ involvement, which is serious.",

    "complaint": "So I've been having pain in my right side, kind of under my ribs, for a few weeks now. It gets worse after I eat, especially if I eat anything greasy or fatty like pizza or fried food. The pain can last for hours and it's pretty intense, like 6 or 7 out of 10. Sometimes it radiates around to my back. I finally went to the doctor last week and she ordered an ultrasound. The ultrasound showed that I have biliary stones - several of them actually. The radiologist also said my gallbladder wall is a bit thickened. My doctor said that rapid weight loss is a major risk factor for developing biliary stones and I've lost about 38 pounds since starting Ozempic 7 months ago. She referred me to a surgeon and said I'll probably need to have my gallbladder removed. In the meantime she told me to stop the Ozempic and stick to a low-fat diet to minimize symptoms. Surgery is scheduled for next month.",

Last week I was rushing to catch a flight and I put the case in my car trunk instead of bringing it into the house. Then I completely forgot about it. This happened to be during a cold snap we had, with overnight temperatures dropping down to around 20 degrees Fahrenheit. The pens were in my car trunk for three full days in subfreezing temperatures before I remembered and went to retrieve them. When I opened the case and looked at the pens, I could see that the solution was partially frozen - there were visible ice crystals inside the cartridge when I held it up to the window. I brought them inside and let them thaw completely at room temperature. Once thawed, the solution looks clear again and the ice crystals are gone, but I know from the storage instructions that Ozempic should never be frozen. Even if it looks normal after thawing, freezing can denature the protein and make the medication ineffective or unreliable. I called my doctor's office and the nurse confirmed I need to throw these pens away and get new ones. Can't use medication that's been frozen even though it looks okay now. So I'm out two pens because of my own mistake. Just documenting this in case anyone else accidentally freezes their medication - don't try to use it even after it thaws.",

He was pretty concerned and asked about all my medications. When I mentioned Ozempic, he said that was probably why I still had stuff in my stomach even after fasting.

When I called the pharmacy they were very apologetic and said it was a system error - apparently this stock should have been flagged as past its date and pulled from their inventory but somehow it wasn't caught. They immediately pulled all remaining pens from that lot off their shelves and are checking their entire inventory system to see how this happened. They replaced my prescription with current, non-past its date pens at no charge, but I'm still concerned about the dose I already took from past its date medication.

He asked if anything had changed with my diabetes management and I told him I started Ozempic about 5 months ago and my blood sugars have improved dramatically - my A1C went from 9.3 to 6.9. He said that paradoxically, when your blood sugar improves too quickly it can cause the diabetic eye disease to temporarily worsen. He called it early worsening phenomenon.

I was looking for better prices and found an online seller advertising bulk discounts - offering twelve pens at a significant savings if you bought in quantity. They claimed to ship from Canada to the US, which I thought was legal for personal use. Placed an order and the pens arrived a few weeks later. As soon as I opened the package, I knew something was off. All the labeling is in French only, no English at all. The box design looks similar to Ozempic packaging but the colors and layout are slightly different from what I'm used to. The color scheme doesn't match the FDA-approved packaging I've seen before. I tried looking up the NDC number online and it returns no results in the US database - like the code doesn't exist in our system. My regular pharmacist looked at it and immediately said this is likely diverted product from the Canadian market that's not approved for sale in the US. Different packaging, different regulatory approval, possibly different manufacturing standards or quality oversight. Or it could be not authentic made to look like Canadian product. Either way, she strongly advised not to use it and to report the seller. The medication came from an unauthorized distribution channel and doesn't meet US regulatory requirements. I'm out the money and learned a hard lesson about buying prescription drugs from random online sellers offering bulk discounts.",

Like I hadn't taken anything at all. So I ended up dialing another 0.5 mg dose and taking it again, and same thing - too quick, too easy, no effect. By the end of the day I had dialed and injected the 0.5 mg dose three times total, thinking maybe it wasn't delivering properly or I was doing something wrong. But I'm experienced with this medication, I know how it should feel and work. My concern is that this particular pen might have diluted medication or incorrect concentration.

First, the transparent plastic shrink wrap or cellophane wrapper that's supposed to be tightly sealed around the outer carton was really loose and baggy. I was able to easily slide it off without tearing anything or breaking any seal - it just slipped right off. That wrapper is supposed to be tamper-evident, so if it comes off that easily, how do I know someone hasn't already opened it? Then I opened the carton and looked at the internal blister seal - you know, that foil or plastic seal that covers the pen inside the tray. That seal was partially open at one corner. Like it had been peeled back or never fully sealed in the first place. You could actually see the edge of the pen through the gap in the seal. Between the loose outer wrapper and the compromised inner seal, the product integrity is really questionable. There's no way to be certain that this pen hasn't been tampered with, contaminated, or exposed to conditions it shouldn't have been. This is an injectable medication - sterility and integrity are absolutely critical. I took it back to the pharmacy immediately and they agreed the packaging failures are unacceptable.
