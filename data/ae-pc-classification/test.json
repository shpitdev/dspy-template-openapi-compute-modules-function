    "complaint": "This is an unfortunate situation caused by a delivery error that resulted in my medication being left unrefrigerated for way too long. I use a specialty pharmacy for my Ozempic and they shipped it via overnight delivery in an insulated package with ice packs like they're supposed to. The tracking showed it was out for delivery yesterday morning and marked as delivered at 10 AM. But I never received it. Turns out the courier mis-delivered it to my neighbor's house two doors down instead of mine. My neighbor has an enclosed front porch that isn't visible from the street, so they didn't notice the package sitting there until this morning when they were leaving for work. They brought it over to me, which was nice of them, but by then it had been sitting on their enclosed porch for almost two full days. When I felt the package, it was room temperature or even warmer - remember, it's been sitting in an enclosed porch for 48 hours. Opened it up and the ice packs were completely thawed, just bags of warm water at this point. Based on the timeline, this medication has been unrefrigerated in a warm environment for approximately 48 hours. The storage requirements say it needs to be refrigerated and shouldn't be exposed to temperatures above 86 degrees for extended periods. I have no idea what temperature it reached sitting in that enclosed porch, but it's definitely been compromised. Called the specialty pharmacy and they're sending a replacement at no charge, but this is a waste of medication due to a delivery error. They said I should not use the mis-delivered pens since the temperature excursion was so prolonged.",

But ... about a month ago, I started having this really bad pain in my right upper abdomen. Like, really sharp pain, especially after . I eat. It got worse and worse, and finally I went to my doctor. They did an ultrasound and found gallstones. The doctor said I have cholelithiasis, and the stones are pretty large. I ended up needing surgery to remove my gallbladder. The surgeon ... said that rapid weight loss can cause gallstones, and since I've lost forty pounds in six months on the Ozempic, that's probably what caused it. So . it's not directly the medication, but the weight loss from the medication led to the gallstones. I'm doing okay after the surgery, but it was scary.

But the patient also has a history of diverticulosis, which can predispose to obstruction. So it's not entirely clear if this is directly from the Ozempic or if the Ozempic just made an you know underlying condition worse. uh But the timing is suspicious, and the constipation from Ozempic definitely contributed.

I went back to the pharmacy to confirm I wasn't missing something, and the pharmacist looked at it and agreed there's definitely a mismatch - the carton says one thing and the pen shows another.

At the very bottom of the cartridge, there's this thick white sediment that's accumulated down there. It's definitely not normal - it looks almost pasty or gel-like, not like the clear liquid solution. I tried gently rolling the pen between my palms like the instructions say to do if you see particles, thinking maybe it would mix back in and dissolve. But even after rolling it for several minutes, the sediment stays clumped at the bottom. It doesn't redissolve or disperse back into the solution. The rest of the solution in the upper portion of the cartridge looks perfectly normal and clear, but this sediment at the bottom is just sitting there. The pen has been properly refrigerated the whole time - I keep my fridge temp between 36 and 40 degrees like you're supposed to. This isn't from improper storage on my end. It looks like the protein in the solution has separated out or aggregated or something. That's a sign of degradation, right? Obviously not using this pen.
