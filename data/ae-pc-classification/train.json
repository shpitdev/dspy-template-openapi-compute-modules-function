I can maybe make out a couple digits but most of it is completely unreadable. And then I looked for the expiration date on the device itself and it's just not there at all. Like, it's missing entirely from the pen body. The outer carton has all the information - lot number, expiration date, everything is printed clearly on the box - but the device itself doesn't have readable traceability information. My understanding is that this information is supposed to be on both the carton and the device for safety reasons, so you can always verify what you're using even if you throw away the box. I need to be able to track which specific pen I'm using in case there's ever a recall or quality issue, and right now I can't do that because the pen itself can't be verified or traced. I contacted the pharmacy to let them know, and they're documenting this issue. They confirmed the lot number from the carton for my records, but this seems like a labeling defect that should be reported.",

Thankfully it came out okay and didn't break under the skin or anything, but my hands were shaking afterward.

This is an injectable medication that's supposed to be sterile, so having any kind of fiber or foreign material in there is just not okay. The pen itself was still sealed in its packaging, and the pharmacy seal on the outside was intact, so this isn't something that got in there after it left the manufacturer. I took pictures of it and brought it back to the pharmacy. The pharmacist agreed it shouldn't be there and filed a report with the manufacturer. She gave me a replacement from a different lot and told me to inspect it carefully too. I'm just worried about quality control if stuff like this is getting through their manufacturing process.",

This is a major problem because my prescription specifically requires that I start at the lower 0.25 mg dose for the first four weeks as a titration period before increasing. If the pen doesn't have 0.25 mg markings, how am I supposed to take that dose? Did they package the wrong pen in this carton? Is the carton labeling wrong? I have no idea but the carton description and the actual device don't match up. I went back to the pharmacy to confirm I wasn't missing something, and the pharmacist looked at it and agreed there's definitely a mismatch - the carton says one thing and the pen shows another. She checked other pens in stock and they all had the correct dose markings that matched their cartons. So mine is some kind of label mismatch or packaging mix-up.

It's like the plunger is frozen in position and won't advance to push the medication out. I've tried everything I can think of - letting it warm up to room temperature in case the cold affected it, gently tapping the pen, checking for any visible obstructions - nothing works. The internal drive mechanism that's supposed to move the plunger forward must be broken or disconnected somehow. This happened after I'd only used two doses from this pen, so there should be at least four more doses remaining that I now can't access.

I'm documenting this as a potential adverse uh event because, you know, we can't rule out the connection, and the patient is experiencing a serious medical finding that I mean requires investigation. The patient is understandably very anxious about this whole situation.",

The injection button on the pen is working when I press it - it depresses normally and I can feel and hear the click that indicates the dose is being delivered. That part seems fine. But after I release pressure on the button, it doesn't spring back up to its original position like it's supposed to. Instead, it stays stuck down in the depressed position. Now I can't dial up my next dose because the button needs to be in the up position before the dose selector will turn, and it's stuck down. This happened after only my second dose from a brand new pen, which means there should be four more doses remaining that I now can't access. I've tried gently pulling on the button to see if it would pop back up, but it won't budge. There's clearly something wrong with the spring mechanism or whatever internal component is supposed to make the button reset after each injection. The pen is basically useless now after only two uses. Brought it to the pharmacy and they confirmed it's a device issue with the button reset mechanism. They replaced it and are sending the defective one back to the manufacturer. Seems like a pretty serious design or manufacturing defect if the button mechanism fails after just two doses.",

Against my better judgment, I ordered from them. The pens arrived after five weeks - no tracking, no temperature control packaging, just showed up one day in my mailbox. When I opened it and looked at the product, so many things were wrong. The carton has multiple spelling errors in the text - like medication spelled wrong, instructions with grammar problems. The pen cap is this weird off-blue color, not the proper shade it should be. And when I held up the pen to check the solution, it has a faint yellowish tint instead of being crystal clear.

Tried again, and the same thing happened - more leaking around the seal. The rubber seal that's supposed to create a watertight connection between the needle and the pen is either damaged or improperly formed. The seal should prevent any leakage, but clearly it's not working. With medication leaking out before I can even inject, I have no way to ensure accurate dosing.

It was also pretty painful, especially when my shirt rubbed against it. I was worried it might be infected so I called the nurse line and they had me come in to get it checked out. The nurse practitioner looked at it and said it's just a local reaction to the medication, not an infection. She said some people have more sensitive skin and react more to the injection. She told me to use a warm compress and it should resolve on its own, which it did after about 4 days. Still a bit nervous about doing my next injection though.",

What if I use it and get the wrong dose? That could be dangerous. I haven't used it yet - I'm waiting to hear back from my doctor about what to do. But I wanted to report um this because this is a label mismatch. It could be a pharmacy dispensing error, or it could be a manufacturing labeling problem. Either way, it's a product identification issue that could affect patient safety.

    "complaint": "So I'm calling because I'm not really sure what category this falls into, but I think it's important to report. My name is Robert, I'm 48 years old, and so I've been on Ozempic for about four months now. I started it because so I have type 2 diabetes and I was really struggling with my weight. My doctor recommended it, and I was hopeful it would help. The first couple of months were actually pretty good - I lost about fifteen pounds, my blood sugar improved, actually I felt okay. But then about a month ago, I started having these weird episodes. Like, I'll be like fine, sitting at my desk working, well and then you know suddenly so I'll get really dizzy , and lightheaded. My heart starts racing, and it feels like my heart is going to beat out of my chest. It's really scary when it like happens. This happens maybe once or twice a week, usually in the afternoon, but so sometimes in the evening too. The episodes last maybe ten or fifteen minutes, and then I so feel okay again, like but really tired afterward. At first I thought maybe it was just stress or anxiety, but it kept happening. So I went to my cardiologist, Dr. Patel. He did an EKG, and he found that I'm having episodes of atrial fibrillation. like That's when your heart beats irregularly. I've never had heart problems before, no family history of heart disease, nothing. I've , actually always been pretty healthy, you know, other than the diabetes. The timing is suspicious because it started about a month after  -  I began Ozempic. But here's the thing - I'm also under a lot of . stress at work. We've had some major projects going on, deadlines, that kind of thing. And I've been drinking more coffee lately, like three or four cups a day, because I've been feeling really fatigued since actually starting the Ozempic. The fatigue is another thing - I'm tired so all the time, which is I mean weird because I'm sleeping okay. So I don't know if it's the medication, or um the stress, or the caffeine, or some combination of all three. My cardiologist said it could be related to the medication, but he's not 100% sure. He said there are case reports of GLP-1 agonists causing cardiac so arrhythmias, but it's not super common. He started me on like a beta blocker, metoprolol, which helps some - the episodes are less frequent and less intense - but I'm still having them. I'm still having episodes maybe once a week now instead of twice. I'm documenting this because even though we're not certain it's the Ozempic, the timing uh suggests it could be related. And it's a serious enough problem that I think it needs to be reported. I'm not you know sure if I should stop the medication um or not - my diabetes is doing so well on it, but these heart episodes are really concerning. My doctor and I are still trying to figure out what to do.",

The plunger barely seemed to move, like the injection was over really quick. When I looked at the dose counter after removing the needle, it had only decreased by maybe 0.1 mg worth, definitely not the full 0.5 mg I had dialed. So either the medication didn't come out, or there's something wrong with the mechanism. I ended up having to dial another 0.4 mg or so and inject again, then check, and had to do this like three or four times total before it finally seemed like I'd gotten the full dose. This is very concerning because I have no idea if I'm actually getting accurate dosing from this pen. Is it under-delivering each time? Is the plunger movement indicator broken but the dose is actually correct? I can't tell, and that's a safety issue.

Her A1C was running around 7.8, which isn't terrible but we wanted to get it lower. So about a month ago, we decided to , start her on Ozempic. It was the 0.5 milligram dose, weekly injection. She was really excited about it, you know, because she'd you know heard all the success stories about weight loss and blood sugar control. Patient started Ozempic, it was the 0.5 milligram dose, weekly injection. This was about three weeks ago, maybe a little more. I want to say it was the first week of October, and now we're at the end of October. So yeah, about three weeks. And after three weeks, they developed severe nausea and vomiting. Like, really severe. The patient called me on a Friday afternoon, and she sounded terrible. She said she'd been vomiting since Wednesday, so for about two days straight. She couldn't keep anything down, not even water. She tried drinking small sips of water, but even that came right back up. The you know patient called me, you know, in distress. She was really ... scared because she'd never experienced anything like this before. They were dehydrated, couldn't eat, lost about eight pounds in just a few days. I mean, this is not normal weight loss, this is from the vomiting. Eight so pounds in three days ... is way too fast, and it's clearly from dehydration , and not being able to eat. , I advised them to stop the medication immediately and come in for evaluation. I told her to come to the clinic right away, but she was too weak to drive, so her husband brought her in. When she got here, she looked terrible - pale, weak, just really sick. We did labs, their electrolytes were  -  off, they needed IV fluids. Her sodium was low, her potassium was low, her  -  BUN and creatinine um were elevated, which suggested dehydration. We started her on IV fluids right there in the clinic, and I sent her to the emergency room for more  -  aggressive hydration. She ended up getting two liters of IV fluids in the ER, and they monitored her for a few hours. This is clearly an adverse reaction to the Ozempic. The timing is too coincidental - started the medication, three weeks later, severe GI  -  symptoms. We've ruled out other causes. The patient had no history of GI issues before this. No food poisoning, no stomach flu going around, nothing. She hadn't changed her diet, hadn't started any other new medications. The only thing that changed was starting the Ozempic. I'm documenting this as an reported issue because it required medical intervention and the patient had to discontinue the like medication. She's not going to continue with it, obviously. The patient is doing better now that they've stopped, but it took about a week for the symptoms to fully resolve. She's back to her baseline now, but she's really shaken up by the whole experience. I'm concerned about trying other GLP-1 agonists with  -  her um because this reaction was so severe. We're going to have to find  -  another approach to managing her diabetes and weight.",

    "complaint": "I'm experiencing some unusual mechanical issues with this pen that have me concerned it might fail completely. When I turn the dose selector dial to set my dose, the mechanism is working - the dial turns and the dose counter advances properly - but something doesn't sound or feel right. The internal mechanism is making these grinding or clicking sounds that are much louder than I'm used to hearing. My previous pens have always been smooth and quiet when turning the dial, maybe a subtle click but nothing loud. This one sounds rough, almost like gears grinding against each other or something. And it doesn't just sound different, it feels different too. There's more resistance when turning, and the motion isn't smooth - it's kind of rough and catches slightly as you turn it. I compared it to an older pen I still have and the difference is really noticeable. I'm worried that whatever is causing this abnormal sound and rough operation is going to get worse and the mechanism might fail completely mid-way through using the pen. Like maybe some internal gear or component is wearing down or misaligned. I can still use it for now since the dose counter is advancing correctly, but I'm keeping a close eye on it and I contacted the pharmacy to let them know.

I called my pharmacy um and they're sending me a replacement, but I wanted to report this because this is a quality issue. The pen should operate smoothly and quietly.

My doctor thinks it might be a mild allergic reaction to either the medication itself or one of the inactive ingredients. She wants me to document each time it happens and if it continues or gets worse, we'll need to switch to a different medication.

I tried gently rolling and swirling the pen like the instructions say to do if you see anything unusual, but the particles didn't dissolve or go away. They just moved around a bit and then settled back at the bottom again. The solution in the upper portion of the cartridge above these particles appears clear and normal, but having any kind of undissolved crystals or precipitate is not normal. I've been using Ozempic for almost a year now and I've never seen anything like this in my previous pens - they've always been completely clear throughout with no particles or crystals. This looks like either the medication has started to crystallize or precipitate out of solution, which would indicate some kind of stability or formulation problem. Obviously I'm not using this pen.

I've been using Ozempic for six months now and all my previous pens have had perfectly clear, water-like solution with no color or cloudiness at all. To make sure I wasn't going crazy, I pulled out my almost-empty pen from last week and compared them side by side. The old pen is crystal clear and the new pen is definitely milky white. Both pens have been stored under identical conditions in my refrigerator at the proper temperature, so this isn't a storage issue on my end. A milky appearance in a solution that should be clear indicates either protein aggregation, where the medication molecules are clumping together, or possibly even microbial foreign material. Either way, this is a critical quality issue. There's no way I'm injecting this into my body. I wrote down the lot number from the carton before I called the pharmacy. They agreed that milky white appearance is definitely abnormal and potentially dangerous. They're having me return the pen so it can be sent to the manufacturer's quality lab for investigation.

    "complaint": "This is unbelievable and honestly makes me question whether I can trust this pharmacy anymore. I filled my prescription for Ozempic today, picked up the package of six pens from the pharmacy counter, drove home, and was putting them in the fridge when I happened to glance at the expiration date. Did a double take because I thought I was misreading it. The expiration date says these pens past its date two months ago. Not expiring soon - already past its date. Two full months past the expiration date. I immediately called the pharmacy and spoke to the pharmacist who dispensed them. She was apologetic and said it was a system error. Apparently this lot should have been flagged as past its date and pulled from their active inventory, but somehow it got missed. The stock was supposedly quarantined in their system, meaning it shouldn't have been available for dispensing, but clearly something failed in their inventory controls and the past its date pens got dispensed to me anyway. This is a critical failure in both inventory management and quality control. Past its date medication could be less effective, potentially unsafe, and definitely shouldn't be given to patients. The pharmacist immediately pulled all remaining pens from that lot off their shelves and is investigating how it happened. They replaced my prescription with current, non-past its date pens at no charge and filed an incident report. But this makes me nervous about what other errors might be happening with their inventory system.",

Between sitting in a hot delivery van all day and then being exposed to the heat during delayed delivery, these pens have been subjected to hours of high temperature exposure that definitely exceeds storage specifications. I refused to accept the delivery and made the driver take it back, then called the mail order pharmacy to file a complaint about their delivery service. They need to use refrigerated vehicles or at minimum ensure deliveries happen within reasonable timeframes, especially during hot weather.",

She's been on it for several months and was doing fine with the injections, but this new pen we picked up last week has a serious problem with the injection button. The button that you press to actually deliver the dose is extremely stiff - like, way too hard to press down. She has some arthritis in her hands and usually can manage the normal resistance, but this pen requires so much force that she literally cannot push the button all the way down to complete the injection. She tried using both thumbs pressing together as hard as she could, and it barely moves. I tried it myself and yes, it's much stiffer than it should be. The button should depress smoothly with moderate pressure, but this one seems to have some kind of mechanical problem that's making it almost impossible to push. This completely prevents her from being able to take her medication as directed, which is obviously a major issue for her diabetes management. We had to go back to the pharmacy and they tested it themselves and agreed something is wrong with the mechanism. They replaced it with a different pen that works normally. This seems like a pretty significant device issue that would affect anyone with any kind of hand strength issues, not just elderly patients.",

The Ozempic is new, started about I mean six weeks ago. um The patient said she's been eating less because of the nausea from Ozempic, which probably contributed, but the medication itself can cause low blood sugar, especially when combined with other diabetes drugs.

I use a specialty pharmacy for my Ozempic and they shipped it via overnight delivery in an insulated package with ice packs like they're supposed to. The tracking showed it was out for delivery yesterday morning and marked as delivered at 10 AM. But I never received it. Turns out the courier mis-delivered it to my neighbor's house two doors down instead of mine. My neighbor has an enclosed front porch that isn't visible from the street, so they didn't notice the package sitting there until this morning when they were leaving for work. They brought it over to me, which was nice of them, but by then it had been sitting on their enclosed porch for almost two full days. When I felt the package, it was room temperature or even warmer - remember, it's been sitting in an enclosed porch for 48 hours. Opened it up and the ice packs were completely thawed, just bags of warm water at this point. Based on the timeline, this medication has been unrefrigerated in a warm environment for approximately 48 hours. The storage requirements say it needs to be refrigerated and shouldn't be exposed to temperatures above 86 degrees for extended periods. I have no idea what temperature it reached sitting in that enclosed porch, but it's definitely been compromised. Called the specialty pharmacy and they're sending a replacement at no charge, but this is a waste of medication due to a delivery error. They said I should not use the mis-delivered pens since the temperature excursion was so prolonged.",

Inside, the gel ice pack that's supposed to keep it cold was completely melted, just warm liquid at that point. And there was one of those temperature indicator strips on the inner packaging, and it clearly showed that the product had been exposed to high temperatures for an extended period. The indicator was red or orange, I forget exactly which, but either way it means the temperature got too high. According to the information sheet, this medication is supposed to stay refrigerated and prolonged heat exposure can make it ineffective or degraded.
