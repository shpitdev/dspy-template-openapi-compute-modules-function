    "complaint": "So, um, I need to report something about my patient. This like is Dr. Sarah Chen calling from the internal medicine clinic. Patient is a 52-year-old woman, she's been my patient um for about three years now. She has type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and she's been struggling with I mean her weight. Her A1C was running around 7.8, which isn't terrible but we wanted to get it lower. So about a month ago, we decided to start her on Ozempic. It was the 0.5 milligram dose, weekly injection. She was really excited about it, you know, because she'd heard all the success stories about weight loss and blood sugar control. Patient started Ozempic, it was the 0.5 milligram dose, weekly injection. This was about three weeks ago, maybe a little more. I want to say it was the first week of October, and now we're at the end of October. So yeah, about three weeks. And after three weeks, they developed severe nausea and vomiting. Like, really severe. The patient called me on a Friday afternoon, and she sounded terrible. She said she'd been vomiting since Wednesday, so for about two days straight. She couldn't keep anything down, not even water. She tried drinking small sips of water, but even that came right back up. The patient called me, you know, in distress. She was um really scared because she'd never experienced anything like this before. They were dehydrated, like couldn't eat, lost about eight pounds in just a few days. I mean, this is not normal weight loss, this is from the vomiting. Eight pounds in three days is way too fast, and it's clearly from dehydration and not being able to eat. I advised them to stop well the medication immediately and come in for evaluation. I told her to come to the clinic right away, but she was too weak to drive, so her husband brought her in. When she got here, she looked terrible - pale, weak, just really sick. We did labs, their electrolytes were off, they needed IV fluids. Her sodium was low, her potassium was low, her BUN and creatinine were ... elevated, which suggested dehydration. We started her on IV fluids right there in the clinic, and I sent her to the emergency room for more aggressive hydration. She ended up getting two liters of IV fluids in the ER, and they monitored her for a few hours. This is clearly an adverse reaction to the Ozempic. The timing is too coincidental - started the medication, three weeks later, severe GI symptoms. We've ruled out other causes. The patient had no history of GI actually issues before this. , No food actually poisoning, no stomach flu going around, nothing. She hadn't uh changed her diet, hadn't started any other new ... medications. The only thing that changed was starting the Ozempic. I'm documenting this as an adverse event because it required medical intervention and the patient had to discontinue the medication. She's not going to continue with you know it, obviously. The patient is doing better now that they've stopped, but it took about a you know week for the symptoms to fully resolve. She's back to her baseline now, but she's really shaken up by the whole experience. I'm concerned about trying other GLP-1 agonists with her because this reaction was so severe. We're going to I mean have to find another approach to managing her diabetes and weight.",

They came in last week because they noticed, you know, a lump in their neck. Like, they were feeling around and found this hard lump on the right side. So I examined them and found a thyroid nodule, it's about two centimeters. We did an ultrasound and, um, there are some concerning features. The radiologist said it has microcalcifications and irregular uh borders, which are, you know, red flags for malignancy. The patient is really worried, obviously. They're asking if this could be related to the Ozempic. I mean, I know there's a black box warning about thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents, but in humans it's less clear. However, the timing is suspicious - they started Ozempic two months ago, and now we have this nodule. We're doing a fine needle aspiration next week to check for cancer. I'm documenting this as a potential adverse event because, you know, we can't rule out the connection, and the patient is experiencing a serious medical finding that requires investigation.

It was in my upper abdomen, radiating to my back. like I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, couldn't do anything. My wife made me go to the emergency room on Wednesday. They did blood work and my amylase was, like, 450, which they said is really high. Normal is under 100. And my lipase was also elevated. The ER doctor diagnosed me with pancreatitis and admitted . me to the hospital. I was there for three days on IV fluids and pain meds. They did a CT scan and well confirmed it was pancreatitis. The doctors asked me about medications and when I told them about Ozempic, they said that could definitely be the cause. I've never had pancreatitis before, I don't drink alcohol, I don't have gallstones. The only thing that changed was starting this medication. I'm really upset , because I was doing well with my blood sugar, but now I'm scared to take it again. The hospital doctor said I should definitely report this as an adverse event.",

She almost passed out when she stood up. So I checked her blood sugar right there in the office and it was 45 milligrams per deciliter. That's dangerously low. Normal is 70 to 100. She was diaphoretic, confused, shaky. I gave her glucose tablets immediately and her sugar came up to 85, but she was still symptomatic. I sent her to the emergency room because hypoglycemia that severe needs monitoring. She's on Ozempic and also metformin, but she's been on metformin for years without issues. The Ozempic is new, started about six weeks ago. The patient said she's been eating less actually because of the nausea from Ozempic, which probably ... contributed, but well the medication itself can cause hypoglycemia, especially when combined with other diabetes drugs.

So I started actually Ozempic three weeks ago, and I've been doing the injections in my thigh, rotating sides. Last week, after my third injection, the injection site got really red and actually swollen. Like, really swollen, probably three inches across. And it was hot to I mean touch and really painful. I put ice on it and took some ibuprofen, but it didn't help much. After a couple days, it started oozing pus, uh which was gross. I called my doctor and they told me to come in. When I got there, the nurse practitioner said it looked infected. She took a swab and started me on antibiotics. The culture came back positive for staph infection. I had to take oral antibiotics for ten days, and the infection well finally cleared up, but it left a scar. you know The doctor said this could be from improper injection technique or contamination, but I've been following the instructions exactly.

And the stomach , cramps are constant, they wake me up at night. I've lost fifteen pounds, but not in a good way - I'm losing weight because I can't eat anything without it going straight through me. I'm afraid to eat because I know what's going to happen. I've tried Imodium, I've tried changing my diet, nothing helps.

I well have an EpiPen because I'm allergic to shellfish, so I used it immediately. My husband drove me to the emergency room. By the time we got there, maybe fifteen minutes  -  later, I was having full-blown anaphylaxis. They gave me more epinephrine, steroids, antihistamines, the I mean whole works.

I you know started Ozempic 2 milligrams about three um months ago, and my blood sugar has been really good - my A1C dropped from 8.5 to 6.8, which is great. But about a month ago, my vision started getting blurry. I thought maybe I just needed new glasses, so I went to the eye doctor. He did a um full exam and found that my diabetic retinopathy has gotten significantly worse. He said it's progressed from mild to moderate-severe in just a few months. There are new blood vessels forming, which is bad. He said this can happen when blood sugar drops too quickly - it's called the early so worsening phenomenon. The rapid improvement in my diabetes actually made my eye disease worse temporarily. I'm going to need laser treatment now, which I didn't need before.

I've always been a pretty happy person. But this was different - I felt hopeless, so worthless, like there was . no point to anything. I stopped wanting . to do actually things I used to enjoy. I couldn't sleep, but I also couldn't get out of bed. And then, um, I started having thoughts about hurting myself. Like, you know really serious thoughts. I was planning how I would do it. My wife noticed something so was wrong and made me see my doctor. My doctor immediately sent me to the psychiatric emergency room. I was admitted to the psychiatric unit and stayed there for five days. They , started me on antidepressants and stopped the Ozempic. The psychiatrist said well this could be related to the medication, though it's not common. I'm doing better now, but I'm still on antidepressants and seeing a therapist.

    "complaint": "So I'm calling because I'm not really sure what category this falls into, but I actually think it's important to report. My name is Robert, I'm 48 years old, and I've been on Ozempic for about four months now. I started it because I have type 2 diabetes and I was really struggling with my weight. My doctor recommended it, and I was hopeful it would help. The first couple of months were I mean actually pretty good - I lost about fifteen pounds, my blood sugar improved, I felt okay. But then about a month ago, I started having these weird episodes. Like, I'll be fine, sitting at my desk working, and then suddenly I'll get really dizzy and you know lightheaded. My heart starts racing, and it feels like my heart is going to beat out of my chest. It's really scary when it happens. This happens uh maybe once or twice a week, usually in the afternoon, but sometimes in the evening too. The episodes last maybe ten or fifteen minutes, and um then I feel okay again, but really tired afterward. At first I thought maybe it was just stress or anxiety, but it kept happening. So I went . to my cardiologist, Dr. Patel. He did an EKG, and he found that I'm having episodes of atrial fibrillation. That's when your heart beats irregularly. I've never had heart problems before, no family history of heart disease, nothing. I've always been pretty healthy, you know, other than the diabetes. The timing is suspicious ... because it started about a month after I began Ozempic. But here's the thing - I'm also under a lot of stress at work. We've had some major projects going on, deadlines, that so kind of thing. And I've been drinking more coffee lately, like three or four so cups a day, because I've been feeling really fatigued since starting the Ozempic. The fatigue is another thing - I'm tired all the time, which is weird because I'm sleeping okay. So I you know don't know if it's the medication, or the stress, or the caffeine, or some combination of all three. My cardiologist said it could be related to the medication, but he's not 100% sure. He said there are case reports of GLP-1 agonists causing cardiac arrhythmias, but it's ... not super common. He started me on a beta blocker, metoprolol, which helps some - the episodes are less frequent and less intense - but I'm still having them. I'm still having episodes maybe once a week now instead of twice. I'm documenting this because even though we're not certain it's the Ozempic, the timing suggests it could be related. And it's a serious enough problem that I think it needs to be reported.

So so I've been on Ozempic for about three months, and I've been having a lot of GI side effects - nausea, some vomiting, diarrhea. It's been manageable, but annoying. Last week, I was vomiting pretty badly, and I guess I aspirated some of it into my lungs. I ended up with aspiration pneumonia. I was hospitalized for four days on IV antibiotics. The doctors said  -  the vomiting from the Ozempic contributed to the aspiration. But I also have GERD, which I've had for years, so it's not like the Ozempic is the only factor. But the vomiting definitely made it worse. I'm better now, but it was scary.

Now, I know that rapid weight loss can cause gallstones, and she's lost about thirty pounds on the Ozempic. So it's not directly the medication causing the gallstones, but the medication caused the weight loss which led to the gallstones.

Her primary care doctor diagnosed it as telogen effluvium, which is hair loss that can happen after stress I mean or major changes to the you know body. The doctor thinks it's related to the rapid weight loss from Ozempic - she's lost about twenty-five pounds in two months, which is a lot. So it's not a direct adverse effect of the medication itself, but rather an indirect effect from the weight loss the medication causes. The patient is really upset because she's losing her hair, and it's affecting her self-esteem. She's asking if she should stop the medication, but her blood sugar is so  -  much better.

We did a CT scan and found a partial bowel obstruction. He was admitted for three days, had to have an NG tube, the whole thing. Now, constipation is a known side effect of Ozempic, and severe constipation can lead to bowel obstruction. But the patient also has a history of diverticulosis, which can predispose to obstruction.

    "complaint": "So I got a new Ozempic pen, and the dose selector is really hard to turn. Like, extremely stiff. It takes a lot of force to dial up like the dose. I'm worried I'm going to break it or something. I've used Ozempic pens before, and they well were never this hard to turn. This is different from my previous pens - those were smooth and easy to dial. This one is really difficult. I'm concerned that if it's this hard to turn, maybe the mechanism is broken or defective. What if it doesn't deliver I mean the right dose because the mechanism is stuck or damaged? I haven't used it yet because I'm worried about getting the wrong dose. I called my pharmacy and they're sending me a replacement, but I wanted to report this because this actually is a quality issue. The pen should work smoothly and easily.

I called my pharmacy and they said they dispensed 0.5 milligrams, so that's what should be in ... there. But the pen says 1.0 milligrams. I'm really confused and concerned. What if I use it and get the wrong dose? That could be uh dangerous. I haven't used it yet - I'm waiting to hear back from my doctor about what to do. But I wanted to I mean report this because this is a labeling error. It could be a you know pharmacy dispensing error, so or it could be a manufacturing labeling problem.
