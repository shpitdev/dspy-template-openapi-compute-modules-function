That could affect my blood sugar control and the therapeutic effects I'm supposed to be getting. I immediately went back to the pharmacy to correct this error.

She's been on it for several months and was doing fine with the injections, but this new pen we picked up last week has a serious problem with the injection button. The button that you press to actually deliver the dose is extremely stiff - like, way too hard to press down. She has some arthritis in her hands and usually can manage the normal resistance, but this pen requires so much force that she literally cannot push the button all the way down to complete the injection. She tried using both thumbs pressing together as hard as she could, and it barely moves. I tried it myself and yes, it's much stiffer than it should be. The button should depress smoothly with moderate pressure, but this one seems to have some kind of mechanical problem that's making it almost impossible to push. This completely prevents her from being able to take her medication as directed, which is obviously a major issue for her diabetes management.

This happened to be during a cold snap we had, with overnight temperatures dropping down to around 20 degrees Fahrenheit. The pens were in my car trunk for three full days in subfreezing temperatures before I remembered and went to retrieve them. When I opened the case and looked at the pens, I could see that the solution was partially frozen - there were visible ice crystals inside the cartridge when I held it up to the window. I brought them inside and let them thaw completely at room temperature. Once thawed, the solution looks clear again and the ice crystals are gone, but I know from the storage instructions that Ozempic should never be frozen. Even if it looks normal after thawing, freezing can denature the protein and make the medication ineffective or unreliable. I called my doctor's office and the nurse confirmed I need to throw these pens away and get new ones. Can't use medication that's been frozen even though it looks okay now.

    "complaint": "So, um, I need to report something about my patient. This is Dr. Sarah Chen calling from the internal medicine clinic. so Patient is ... a 52-year-old woman, she's been my patient for about um three years now. She has type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and she's been struggling with her weight. Her A1C was running around 7.8, which isn't terrible but we wanted to get it lower. So about a month ago, we decided to start her on Ozempic. It was the 0.5 milligram dose, weekly injection. She was really excited about it, you know, because she'd heard all the success stories about weight loss and blood sugar control. Patient started Ozempic, it was the 0.5 milligram dose, weekly injection. This was about um three weeks ago, maybe a little more. I want to say it was the first week of October, and now we're at the end of October. So yeah, about three you know weeks. And after three weeks, they developed severe nausea and vomiting. Like, really severe. The patient called me on a Friday afternoon, and she sounded terrible. She said she'd been vomiting since Wednesday, so for about two days straight. She couldn't keep anything down, not even so water. She tried drinking small sips of water, but even that came uh right actually back up. The patient called me, you know, in distress. She was really scared because she'd never experienced anything like this before. They were dehydrated, couldn't ... eat, lost about eight pounds in just a few days. I mean, this is not normal weight loss, this is from the vomiting. Eight pounds in three days is way too fast, and it's clearly from dehydration and not being able to eat. I advised them to stop the medication immediately and come in for evaluation. I told her to come to the clinic right away, but she was too weak I mean to drive, so her husband brought her in. When she got here, . she looked terrible - pale, weak, just really sick. We did labs, their electrolytes were off, they needed IV fluids. Her sodium was low, her potassium was low, her BUN and creatinine were elevated, which suggested dehydration. We started her well on IV you know fluids right there in the clinic, and I sent her to the emergency room for more aggressive hydration. She ended up getting two liters of IV fluids in the ER, and they monitored her for a few hours. This is clearly an adverse reaction to the Ozempic. The timing is too coincidental - started the medication, three weeks later, severe GI symptoms. We've ruled out other causes. The patient had no history of GI issues before this. No food poisoning, no stomach flu going around, nothing. She hadn't changed her diet, hadn't started any other new medications. The only thing that changed was starting the Ozempic. I'm documenting this as an adverse event because it required medical intervention and the patient had to discontinue the medication. She's not going to continue with like it, obviously. The I mean patient is doing better now that they've uh stopped, but it took about a week for the symptoms to fully resolve. She's back to her baseline now, but she's really shaken up by the whole experience. I'm concerned about trying other GLP-1 agonists with her because this reaction was so severe. We're going to have to find another approach to managing her diabetes and weight.",

The pen tip where you screw on the needle was totally exposed, no protective barrier covering it. That seal is supposed to be there to maintain sterility of the injection interface until you're ready to use the pen, and mine didn't have one. This seems like a serious sterility issue because that's the exact area where the needle attaches and where the medication comes out. If it was exposed during shipping and handling without that protective seal, there's no way to guarantee it's still sterile. I mean, any dust, bacteria, contaminants could have gotten on that surface. I absolutely cannot use this pen when the sterility of the injection point is compromised. Brought it back to the pharmacy immediately and they agreed this is a critical packaging component failure.

I can see through the window that there's still medication in the cartridge - probably three or four doses worth based on the liquid level - but the plunger isn't moving at all when I try to dial or inject. The dose selector turns and clicks normally, the injection button depresses, but nothing happens with the actual plunger mechanism. It's like the plunger is frozen in position and won't advance to push the medication out. I've tried everything I can think of - letting it warm up to room temperature in case the cold affected it, gently tapping the pen, checking for any visible obstructions - nothing works. The internal drive mechanism that's supposed to move the plunger forward must be broken or disconnected somehow. This happened after I'd only used two doses from this pen, so there should be at least four more doses remaining that I now can't access. The medication is right there in the cartridge, I can see it, but there's no way to get it out because the delivery mechanism is completely jammed. Pharmacy confirmed this is a device malfunction with the plunger drive system and replaced the pen. They're reporting it to the manufacturer as a mechanical failure that prevented dose delivery.",

My doctor was concerned enough that she ordered this test where I had to eat radioactive eggs - weird, I know - and then they scan you to see how fast your stomach empties. Turns out mine is emptying really slowly. She said it's called gastroparesis and it might be from the Ozempic.

That should last me through my next refill date based on my weekly dosing schedule. But when I checked the expiration dates on all four pens, they all expire in just two weeks from now. Two weeks! There's no way I can use four pens in two weeks when I'm only supposed to take one dose per week. By my calculation, I'll use maybe one pen, possibly start the second one, but then at least two of these pens, probably three, will expire before I can even use them. That's a complete waste of medication and money. Called the pharmacy to explain the problem and ask for replacement pens with longer dating. They checked with their inventory system and their wholesaler, and basically said this is what they received and they don't have any better-dated stock available right now. Their wholesaler apparently sent them short-dated product and they can't replace it. This is really poor inventory management somewhere in the distribution chain. Someone sent product that's about to expire to pharmacies knowing that patients won't be able to use it in time. Now I'm stuck either wasting medication or I don't know what.

They did blood work and said my kidney function was off - my creatinine was elevated, whatever that means.

Like I hadn't taken anything at all. So I ended up dialing another 0.5 mg dose and taking it again, and same thing - too quick, too easy, no effect. By the end of the day I had dialed and injected the 0.5 mg dose three times total, thinking maybe it wasn't delivering properly or I was doing something wrong. But I'm experienced with this medication, I know how it should feel and work. My concern is that this particular pen might have diluted medication or incorrect concentration. Like maybe the active ingredient amount is lower than it should be. Otherwise why would I feel absolutely nothing after three doses when one dose normally has a clear effect?

I've been using Ozempic for almost a year now and I've never seen anything like this in my previous pens - they've always been completely clear throughout with no particles or crystals. This looks like either the medication has started to crystallize or precipitate out of solution, which would indicate some kind of stability or formulation problem. Obviously I'm not using this pen.

Everything seemed fine. But then the next day I was looking at the pen and happened to glance at the expiration date printed on the carton, and I realized it says it expired last month. Like a full month ago. This medication was already expired when the pharmacy dispensed it to me, and I already took one dose from it before I even noticed. When I called the pharmacy they were very apologetic and said it was a system error - apparently this stock should have been flagged as expired and pulled from their inventory but somehow it wasn't caught. They immediately pulled all remaining pens from that lot off their shelves and are checking their entire inventory system to see how this happened. They replaced my prescription with current, non-expired pens at no charge, but I'm still concerned about the dose I already took from expired medication. I mean, my doctor said it's probably fine, it's not like it becomes toxic or anything, but the effectiveness might be reduced.

With a cracked cap that doesn't stay on, I'm concerned that the pen mechanism could get damaged or the injection interface could get contaminated. I went back to the pharmacy to show them and they gave me a replacement pen from their stock. But get this - the replacement pen they gave me also has minor cracks in the cap, not as bad as the first one but still visible.

The pharmacist pulled a few more from stock to check and found that several pens from the same lot had cap cracks of varying severity.

Ordered three pens, paid through some payment system I wasn't familiar with, and waited. The pens showed up after about three weeks. At first glance the packaging looks pretty genuine - has the Novo Nordisk branding, the blue pens, all of that. But when I started looking more closely, some things didn't add up. I tried scanning the 2D barcode on the box with my phone using the manufacturer's verification app, and it gave me an error message. Wouldn't scan properly or verify. Then I went to the Novo Nordisk website where they have that verification portal where you can enter the lot number, and when I put in the lot number from my pens, the system said it cannot find that lot number in their database. Like it doesn't exist in their records. And when I looked really carefully at the holographic security seal on the carton, it seems slightly misaligned or crooked, not perfectly applied like I'd expect from a professional pharmaceutical manufacturer. I showed all this to my regular pharmacist and she said these are almost certainly counterfeit and I absolutely should not use them.

I had to eat these eggs with radioactive stuff in them and then lie under a camera for like 4 hours while they took pictures. The results showed that my stomach is emptying really slowly - took twice as long as it should. Doctor said it's gastroparesis and it's probably from the Ozempic.

    "complaint": "So I'm calling because I'm not really sure . what category this falls into, but I think it's important to report. My name is Robert, I'm 48 years old, and I've been on Ozempic for about four so months now. I started it because I have type 2 diabetes and uh I like was really struggling with my weight. My doctor recommended it, and I was hopeful it would help. The first couple of months were actually pretty good - I lost about fifteen pounds, my blood sugar improved, I felt okay. But then about a month ago, I started having these weird episodes. Like, I'll be fine, sitting at my desk working, and then suddenly I'll get really dizzy and lightheaded. My heart starts racing, and it feels like my heart is going to beat out of my chest. It's really scary when it happens. This happens maybe once or twice a week, usually in the afternoon, but sometimes in the evening too. The episodes last maybe ten or fifteen minutes, and then I feel okay again, but really tired afterward. At first I thought maybe it was just stress uh or anxiety, but it kept happening. So I went to my cardiologist, Dr. Patel. He did an EKG, and he found that I'm having episodes of atrial fibrillation. That's when your heart beats irregularly. I've never had heart problems before, , no family history of heart disease, nothing. I've so always been pretty healthy, you know, other than the diabetes. The timing is suspicious because it started about a month after I began Ozempic. But here's the thing - I'm also under you know a lot of stress at work. We've had some major projects going on, deadlines, that kind of thing. And I've been drinking more coffee lately, like three or four cups a day, because I've been feeling really fatigued since starting the Ozempic. The fatigue is another thing - I'm tired all the time, which is weird because I'm sleeping okay. So I don't know if it's the medication, or the stress, or the caffeine, or some combination of all three. My cardiologist said it could be related to the medication, but he's not 100%  -  sure. He said there are case reports of GLP-1 agonists causing cardiac arrhythmias, but it's not super common. He started me on a beta blocker, metoprolol, which helps some - the episodes are less frequent and less intense - but I'm still having them. I'm still having episodes maybe once a week now instead of twice. I'm documenting this because even though we're not certain it's the I mean Ozempic, well the timing suggests it could be related. And it's a serious enough problem that I think it needs I mean to be reported. I'm not sure if I should stop the medication or not - my diabetes is doing so well on it, but these heart episodes well are really concerning. My doctor and I are still trying to figure out what to do.",

That wrapper is supposed to be tamper-evident, so if it comes off that easily, how do I know someone hasn't already opened it? Then I opened the carton and looked at the internal blister seal - you know, that foil or plastic seal that covers the pen inside the tray. That seal was partially open at one corner. Like it had been peeled back or never fully sealed in the first place. You could actually see the edge of the pen through the gap in the seal. Between the loose outer wrapper and the compromised inner seal, the product integrity is really questionable. There's no way to be certain that this pen hasn't been tampered with, contaminated, or exposed to conditions it shouldn't have been. This is an injectable medication - sterility and integrity are absolutely critical. I took it back to the pharmacy immediately and they agreed the packaging failures are unacceptable.

It's not in the solution itself - the solution appears clear - but you can see it on the inside wall of the glass. Looks like some kind of residue or discoloration that formed a ring around the inside circumference. At first I thought maybe it was just a reflection or something on the outside of the glass, but when I look carefully and turn the pen, it's definitely on the inner surface. Both pens from the same carton have this same marking. My previous pens from other batches never had any marks or discoloration on the glass at all. The cartridge glass has always been perfectly clear inside and out. I'm concerned this could be residue from the filling process, or discoloration from the medication degrading and depositing something on the glass, or maybe even contamination.

    "complaint": "So this is kind , of a gray area, but I think it needs to be reported. My patient has been on Ozempic for about three months, and he's been having constipation. Like, really bad constipation. He's been taking laxatives, but they're not helping much. Last week, he came into the ER with severe abdominal pain and distension. We did a CT scan and found a partial bowel obstruction. He was admitted for three days, had to have an NG tube, the whole thing. Now, constipation is a known side effect of Ozempic, and severe constipation can lead to bowel obstruction. But the patient also has a ... history of diverticulosis, which can predispose to obstruction. So it's not entirely clear if this is directly from the Ozempic or if the Ozempic just you know made an underlying condition worse. But the timing is suspicious, and the constipation from Ozempic definitely contributed. I'm . documenting this as an adverse event  -  because the medication's side effect led to a serious complication requiring so hospitalization.",

I can't understand how to use the pen because I can't read the instructions. I called my pharmacy and they said this is a labeling error - I should have received English instructions. They're going to send me the correct instructions, but I'm concerned about this. What if someone who doesn't speak English uses the pen incorrectly because they can't read the instructions? This could be dangerous. I'm also wondering if there are other labeling errors - like, is the expiration . date correct? Is the dose information correct? I haven't used the pen yet because I want to make sure I understand how to use it correctly. This is a regulatory compliance issue. The product should have instructions in the correct language for the market it's being sold in.

    "complaint": "My eye doctor sent me to see a retina specialist because she was concerned about changes she saw in my last eye exam. The specialist did a really comprehensive examination with all these different machines and scans. He said my diabetic retinopathy has progressed quite a bit since my last full evaluation which was about 6 months ago. There's some bleeding in the back of both eyes now and some new abnormal blood vessels growing. He said this is proliferative retinopathy and it needs to be treated. When he asked about my diabetes management, I told him I've been on Ozempic for about 4 months and my A1C has come down from 9.1 to 6.7, which I thought was great. He explained that sometimes when your blood sugar improves really quickly, the retinopathy can get worse before it gets better - it's called early worsening phenomenon or something like that. He scheduled me for laser treatment to prevent further damage and wants to see me monthly. I'm terrified about losing my vision.",

    "complaint": "I was getting ready to take my very first dose of Ozempic today, so I followed the instructions exactly like it says in the booklet. I attached the needle, did the priming procedure, turned the dial to release the air and prime it, heard the clicking sound like it's supposed to make, but then nothing. No drop appeared at the needle tip at all. So I thought maybe it was the needle, took it off, put on a brand new one from the pack, tried again. Same thing. Clicked, but no medication came out. I probably tried this about five or six times with two different needles and I'm getting nowhere. The mechanism inside seems to be working - I can hear the clicks, the dial turns, but it's like the medication just won't flow through. Something must be blocked inside the pen. I called the pharmacy and they said this shouldn't happen and to bring it back for a replacement. Really frustrating because I was supposed to start my treatment today and now I have to wait.",

    "complaint": "This is unbelievable and honestly makes me question whether I can trust this pharmacy anymore. I filled my prescription for Ozempic today, picked up the package of six pens from the pharmacy counter, drove home, and was putting them in the fridge when I happened to glance at the expiration date. Did a double take because I thought I was misreading it. The expiration date says these pens expired two months ago. Not expiring soon - already expired. Two full months past the expiration date. I immediately called the pharmacy and spoke to the pharmacist who dispensed them. She was apologetic and said it was a system error. Apparently this lot should have been flagged as expired and pulled from their active inventory, but somehow it got missed. The stock was supposedly quarantined in their system, meaning it shouldn't have been available for dispensing, but clearly something failed in their inventory controls and the expired pens got dispensed to me anyway. This is a critical failure in both inventory management and quality control. Expired medication could be less effective, potentially unsafe, and definitely shouldn't be given to patients. The pharmacist immediately pulled all remaining pens from that lot off their shelves and is investigating how it happened. They replaced my prescription with current, non-expired pens at no charge and filed an incident report. But this makes me nervous about what other errors might be happening with their inventory system.",
